            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>k, or of its Author: But only deſire the Reader, if he like the Counſels which are here given, for the promoting and better order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Devotion, and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of a pious Soul in peace and chearfulneſs, that he would be ſo kind and faithfull to himſelf as to follow them. And the hope I have,
<pb facs="tcp:94275:3"/>
that after a peruſal, they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite him ſo to do, makes me ſecure the Author will not be diſpleaſed to ſee that expoſed to publique view, which was at firſt intended only for a private Perſons uſe. For if the Advice be good, the more common it grows ſo much the better it is; and it will not be the leſs mine, when it is gone into other hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plato,</hi> I am told, calls Love, the Ornament of all, both of the Gods and of Men; the faireſt and moſt excellent Guide, whom every man ought to follow, and celebrate with Hymnes and Praiſes: And what is there in which we can better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and declare it to others, than in communicating to them, that which we hold in higheſt eſteem
<pb facs="tcp:94275:3"/>
our ſelves? It was that which firſt produced this Treatiſe, and from thence it comes abroad.</p>
            <p>That which the ſame Perſon ſaith is the Father of delights, of mirth, of whatſoever is gracefull and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, was the Parent of this Book: And therefore let it be accepted with the ſame kindneſs wherewith it was writ, and is now Printed. Let all the faults (if you find any) be overlookt with a friendly eye; and do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage ſo excellent a vertue as Friendſhip (to which we owe the beſt things in the World) by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and harſh cenſures of any thing that it produces.</p>
            <p>But I need not, I think, be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
<pb facs="tcp:94275:4"/>
about this: the pious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Book being ſufficient to give it protection, if it cannot gain it approbation. It hurts no body, and therefore may paſs it ſelf with more ſafety; and it offers its ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to do every body good; which me thinks ſhould be taken kindly, even by thoſe who ſtand in no need of it. As for thoſe who ſhall make uſe of it, and find any benefit by it; they will complain perhaps on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Author's thriftineſs, and wiſh he had been more liberal of his Advice. And ſo, it's like, he would, if he had not conſulted his Friends eaſe more than his own; and conſidered rather what would be uſefull, than what would make a great ſhow. You will take a wrong meaſure of his kindneſs, if
<pb facs="tcp:94275:4"/>
you judg of it by the bulk of the Book; which was purpoſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted into a little room, that it might be a conſtant Companion, and as eaſie to carry in mind, as it is to carry in ones hand. And let the defects of it be what they will, they may be ſupplied out of one of the Rules, you here meet with, if you pleaſe to make uſe of it; which is, to <hi>chuſe a good Guide;</hi> from whom you may receive further Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in any thing that is neceſſary for your Progreſs in Piety; or for the ſetling your Conſcience in peace.</p>
            <p>And that we may none of us ever want ſuch a faithful and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Perſon to conduct us, and that we may receive a benefit by theſe and all other good Counſels; let us
<pb facs="tcp:94275:5"/>
heartily joyn in that Prayer to God, which is the Collect for this Day, and add it often to the enſuing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions.</p>

            <p>MAN bears ſome reſemblance, and may not unfitly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, to a Diamond or ſuch like precious ſtone; whoſe darker parts confeſs that it is of the earth, but the brighter look as if it had bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed ſome rayes from the Sun or Stars. He is a ſubſtance (I mean) conſiſting of a terreſtrial Body, and celeſtial Spirit: with his Feet he touches the earth, but with his Head he touches Heaven. Though the neighbourhood knows whence his Body came, and remembers the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94275:7"/>
time perhaps when it lay in the dark Cell of his mothers womb; yet his Soul doth abſolutely deny that it is of ſo mean extraction: And, caſting its eyes upward, calls to mind its high deſcent and parentage; and takes it to be no preſumption to affirm that, <hi>we are the off-ſpring of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He cannot therefore but find in himſelf propenſions and deſires, not only different from, but contrariant to each other. For ſince two worlds meet in him, and he is placed in the confines of heaven and earth, his will muſt needs hang between two widely diſtant goods: the one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding pleaſures to his body, and the other to his mind. And though once there was a time when theſe two preſerved ſuch a friendſhip and gave ſuch due ſatisfaction to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others juſt intereſts and inclinations, that they did not break out into an open war; yet this peace laſted not ſo long, as to let us feel the bleſſings
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94275:7"/>
and happineſs thereof. But that part whoſe kindred and acquaintance was in this world, apprehended the firſt occaſion, that offered it ſelf, to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with the other, whoſe native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey was not ſo viſible through walls of fleſh; and denying to conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, plainly rebelled and entred into a ſtate of hoſtility againſt it. This it might do with the more eaſe, becauſe two parts of thoſe three into which the Soul is ordinarily divided, ſtand very much affected to the Body, and its concernments. The <hi>Deſiring</hi> part, that is always ready to run to any thing and embrace it,<note place="margin">

               </note> which hath the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a bodily good: the <hi>Angry</hi> part, that is no leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſhun, and to make defence againſt, whatſoever ſeems to be a bodily evil: to the <hi>Rational</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the direction and government of theſe; which that it may manage aright, it is to maintain a conſtant converſation with an higher good,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94275:8"/>
to which all the lower deſires and paſſions ought to be ſubordinate and ſubject.</p>
            <p>Theſe are handſomely compared by a noble Greek Philoſopher to the Three Ranks or Orders of men, that are in a City:<note place="margin">

But ſo it falls out, that as the Slaves and the Souldiers ſometimes prove mutinous and unruly, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining their forces together make themſelves maſters of the Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the true peace and liberty: ſo have the violent deſires that are in us
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94275:8"/>
of enjoying a ſenſual good, and of avoiding all outward evils, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, grown to ſuch a head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong and unbridled humor; that they have overtopt reaſon, and refuſe to hearken to the authority and to obey the dictates of our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Many wayes have been tryed both by God and Man to reduce them to a good agreement again: But though all fair ſatisfaction hath been offered, and is allowed, to the lower part, it would not yield to a ſurrender of that power and ſoveraignty, which it hath uſurped. As a company of Factious people that ſtrive for ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority over their Governours, when they have compaſſed their deſigns and poſſeſſed themſelves of the throne, are with more difficulty ſuppreſſed, than they were before kept in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: So it is with the multitude of mens furious luſts and paſſions, now that they have dethroned reaſon,

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94275:9"/>
advanced themſelves into the ſeat of Government. Having taſted very ſtrongly of a ſenſual good, and felt the ſweetneſs (as they take it) of being abſolute; they are loth to be denyed the licenſe which they have ſo long enjoyed, and will by no means grant any obedience to be due to an higher power.</p>
            <p>God was pleaſed therefore to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf in our fleſh, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the claim and aſſert the title of our Mind and Underſtanding; and by ſhewing its undoubted right of Government, to take up this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, and put an end to theſe ſad conteſts, which have hapned to the ruin of mankind. In the Lord Jeſus there appeared ſuch an abſolute and conſtant dominion of the Spirit, as in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> after his fall, there did of the Fleſh. And he came not only to give us a glorious Example, to overawe all unruly motions in us by his divine Authority, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire

our feeble Spirits with ſome cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, by his great and precious promiſe of eternal life: but to comfort us (by his Death, Reſurrection, and Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the right hand of the Majeſty on high) with the hopes of a mighty power from above to aid and aſſiſt us in our Chriſtian conflict with all unreaſonable deſires. This he actually ſends into our ſouls, to give them ſufficient force and ability, for the doing of their duty, redeeming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from this ſlavery, and recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ancient rights and liberty.</p>
            <p>And in all thoſe who attend unto his holy Counſels, and receive his Divine grace, and are renewed and led by his good Spirit, there appear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny happy tokens of the Souls victory; and they are daily winning new conqueſts over the fleſh with all the affections and luſts thereof. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly good ſeems ſo great in their eyes that they cannot (upon any terms) think of ſubmitting their ſouls any
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94275:10"/>
longer, to attend wholly or chiefly upon the pleaſures and ſatisfactions of the lower man. The mind is furniſhed with ſuch right opinons, the Will is become ſo tractable, and compliant with their reſolutions, the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons grow ſo ſubject and obedient to the orders and commands of both; in ſhort, God and his will is ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly loved, and their Spirit ſtrives ſo earneſtly after the ardors and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Devotion of love; that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Government is again reſtored, its loſt authority, rights and royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are manifeſtly recovered, and they live in good hope to be more than conquerors, over all temptations from the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil; aſpiring to an humble rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, glorying and triumph over all theſe enemies.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all this, theſe men remain ſtill both fleſh and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The Body is not deſtroyed, the goods wherein it delights have not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94275:10"/>
altered their nature, its habitation is not removed from their neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and it retains the ſame incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them, and they are often remembring it of its forepaſt fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and, which is worſt of all, the Soul cannot preſently recover its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health and ſoundneſs; but feels the maimes and the bruiſes that it got, when it was formerly beaten down and oppreſſed by them. Hence it comes to paſs that, for ſome time at leaſt, there are many motions made for a revolt; and every thing in the world is tampering with the heart, to corrupt and bring it over again to their party; and the mind it ſelf, in ſome fits, almoſt wearied with their importunity, may be ready to lend half an ear to theſe ſolicitations. There is not ſuch a perfect peace eſtabliſhed, but there will be ſome endeavours of the fleſhly part to reſume its power, and get into its hand its pretended li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Yea, by the violence of many outward accidents, the mind may
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94275:11"/>
ſometimes fall into a dream, and be tempted to muſe whether there be ſufficient reaſon to prefer thoſe future and unſeen goods, before preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments: The Will may begin to bend it ſelf to ſome civil carriage and fair complyance with the fleſh: the Affections, being much wooed and complimented, may feel themſelves in danger to be inveigled; or the heat, at leaſt, and livelineſs of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion may, in ſuch a condition, be much abated and impaired.</p>
            <p>And indeed it is not to be expected that the Body ſhould go along as nimbly as the Spirit would have it, towards a good with which it is not acquainted. All that the Mind can do, is to take a very great care, that it move it ſelf with as ſlow a pace towards that good to which the other is moſt inclined. That we love theſe outward things cannot be blamed: but it will require much diligence to keep our hearts from doting on that,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94275:11"/>
for which we naturally have no ſmall affection. That we hold ſome acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with them, can by no means be avoided: but that we grow not too familiar with them ought to be our prudent care, and cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome difficulty be prevented. There will ſome kindneſſes paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, and we cannot deny the Body theſe ſenſible pleaſures: but that our Souls ſhould thereby ſuffer themſelves to be undermined and their intereſt betrayed, there is no ſmall danger. For while the Good of the body is near at hand and the Good of the ſoul is at ſome diſtance, while that which is near ſeems great and that which is remote ſeems ſmall, while the one is preſent and the other future, while things preſent call upon us and we muſt earneſtly call for things future, while the one is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes before us and the other comes but at certain ſeaſons, while the one is of old and the other but of a late acquaintance (we having been bred
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94275:12"/>
up with the one and being but brought to the other, the one coming firſt and the other thereby preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced) as long, I ſay, as there are theſe plain advantages on the one ſide, if we uſe not attentive diligence to give the ſoul juſt and true informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they will prevail with it incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately to ſlight the far greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages on the other. Juſt as you ſee ſometimes a wild-headed and unthrifty Heir, though there be no compariſon between his future inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance and a ſmall ſum of preſent money, yet, for the pleaſing of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſion, ſells the reverſion of an eſtate, which, after ſome years, would make him very rich and happy: So do ſouls that are not ſerious and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate, heedleſly reſign, for mere trifles, their apparant title to ſuch things as are of moſt importance to their true and laſting felicity. Though the poſſeſſions of the other world be as far beyond all our enjoyments here, as this world is above nothing; yet
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94275:12"/>
becauſe theſe things here are preſent, and becauſe they are ever ſoliciting and offering themſelves to us, and becauſe they entertain our deſires with pleaſure, and becauſe they put us to little pains to give our ſelves the fruition of them, they are wont to prevail with ſleepy and careleſs minds to purchaſe them, though they part with all their intereſt in the other world, as the price of the bargain.</p>
            <p>From hence there grows a neceſſity of that precept of vigilance and watchfulneſs, which our Lord Chriſt hath given his Souldiers; leſt through ſubtle inſinuations, or frequent and violent aſſaults, this old enemy get up again, and eſtabliſh it ſelf in a new and more grievous tyranny. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> deſervedly reproved the folly of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> who, as the ſtory goes, was troubled in his mind for want of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment after the conqueſt (as he imagined) of the whole world; for he ſhould have conſidered (ſaid that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94275:13"/>
great Emperour) that there is no leſs pains and wiſdom requiſite to keep a poſſeſſion, than there is to win it. We muſt not think that we have ended our warfare, when we have reduced the fleſh to ſome terms of obedience and peace; but the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſoul will find it neceſſary to keep a conſtant guard: or elſe that enemy, whoſe weakneſs conſiſts in our watchfulneſs, will ſucceed in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to get all into its hands once more, and ſettle it ſelf in that throne from whence it was ſo happily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd. Whenſoever we grow remiſs, the experience of all the world tells us, our ſouls loſe as much in a week as they have been acquiring by a whole years labour. To fall down is very eaſie and we tumble apace: but we cannot climb the hill without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and by little ſteps and ſlow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we advance towards the upper world and the celeſtial bleſſedneſs; which will coſt us much patience and unwearied induſtry before we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:94275:13"/>But what will keep the Mind, may you demand, from this remiſneſs? what remedies can you preſcribe to preſerve a feeble ſpirit, from being ſtupified and lull'd aſleep ſometimes with theſe gaudy Poppies, theſe fair and ſoft enjoyments which appear every where, and continually ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round us? who is able to keep a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual watch and never take a nap? In ſuch a long work who can chuſe but be ſometimes weary? When I conſider my own infirmity and the enemies ſtrength, my natural love to theſe worldly things and their reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs importunity, the length of my journey, and my aptneſs to be tired, and eſpecially when I ſee ſo many ſeeming Champions that have been overcome, ſo many that did run well who have grown ſlack or retired, I am afraid may your heart ſay, that I ſhall never hold out to the end, and maintain the ground ſtedfaſtly on which I ſtand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:94275:14"/>And indeed it muſt be confeſſed, that the ſpirit is not alwayes alike able to make a valiant reſiſtance and couragious oppoſition. But what through the defect and diſorder of the bodily inſtruments which it uſes, and what through ſtrange occaſions and unuſual accidents that it meets withal to ſurpriſe it, and what through the ſtrength of ſome one object either of joy or grief or ſuch like, that ſeiſes mightily upon the imagination, and what through its own timorouſneſs which makes the enemy grow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, and what through the want now and then of thoſe delectable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gods good Spirit, and thoſe heavenly conſolations wherewith it hath been tranſported; it may fall into ſome liſtleſneſs and dulneſs, and grow ſo faint, that it hath but little heart to maintain its Chriſtian war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>
            <p>But yet for all this you ought not to deſpond nor be quite diſcouraged at
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94275:14"/>
the thoughts that you may poſſibly one day find your ſelf in theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy circumſtances. You are not left without a Remedy, either for the preventing of the fall of your ſoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this condition; or for the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and raiſing of it up, ſhould it chance to ſlide into it; or for its ſafety and preſervation, that it may receive no harm whilſt it lies therein, and can for the preſent meet with no means to rid it ſelf of ſo great a burthen. This little Book comes to bring you ſome relief, and lend you ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and aid in ſuch a caſe. It hath no other buſineſs, but to give your ſoul the beſt aſſiſtance that mine can afford it for its ſecurity: that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever aſſault may be made upon you, whatſoever weakneſſes you may feel in your ſelf, and whatſoever advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the enemy may make of them, the fleſh notwithſtanding may never be able to draw you back again underits power; but your Spirit may ſtand faſt in its pious reſolution, and come
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94275:15"/>
off with victory and triumph at the laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And let the Divine Spirit of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Grace, I humbly beſeech the Father Almighty, ſo guide my Pen, that your Soul may receive no leſs benefit by the reading of theſe Papers, than mine doth contentment in the writing of them, and that the Good they do you may be proportionable to the Love from whence they come.</hi> Amen.</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:94275:15"/>
               <head>I.</head>
               <p>AND in the firſt place let me adviſe you to <hi>bring your ſelf into as great an acquaintance and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity as ever you can, with unſeen and ſpiritual things; and to make your mind ſo ſenſible of them, that they may ſeem the moſt real and ſubſtantial beings.</hi> You eaſily diſcern how ſutable this Counſel is to the foregoing diſcourſe; and you can tell your ſelf how much of our liſtleſneſs and want of ſpiritual appetite proceeds from hence, that theſe outward things preſs continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally very hard upon us, and make us feel that they have a being and a ſolid ſubſiſtance: but the other rarely touch us with any force, and ſo appear as if they were only in our fancy. Our ſoul ſeems to us, in our careleſs thoughts, as if it were but a breath or a thin vapour: But our Body we perceive to be a maſſy bulk, of whoſe concerns we are therefore very appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94275:16"/>
The Divine being, though the cauſe of all others, ſeems but like a ſhadow; on whom our Soul having no faſt hold, it is no wonder that we rather catch at thoſe things which we can graſp, and feel to have ſome ſubſtance in them. The report of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal life and bliſs in heaven comes to us like a common ſtory, of which there is ſome probability, but no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; and that inclines us to cloſe ſo greedily with the enjoyments of this life, which make more ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on our body, than the other on our Spirit. The glaſs through which we look upon this lower world makes every thing we deſire appear exceeding great; nay multiplies and increaſes it to vaſt dimenſions: but when we caſt our eyes upward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our heavenly countrey, alas! things appear there (as if we had turn'd about the perſpective) ſo little; ſo remote, ſo like nothing, that we can ſcarce diſcern them, or retain any remembrance of them. We have a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94275:16"/>
kind of opinion and half perſwaſion concerning theſe inward and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual objects, but we have a ſenſe and full apprehenſion of our outward enjoyments. Now though opinion may govern us, and we may follow it while there are no conſiderable impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments to oppoſe it; yet when any difficulty ariſes, or ſomething croſſes our way to which we ſtand very much affected, it will ſoon ſubmit it ſelf and leave us to our new inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe it is but an opinion. We muſt confirm our ſouls therefore in a <hi>full belief</hi> of thoſe ſpiritual things: which thus differs from a bare <hi>opinion</hi> of them. The one is grounded only upon probable reaſons, or on good reaſon but half conſidered and feebly aſſented unto: the other upon clear and manifeſt evidences, well digeſted and fully entertained. So that the one leaves us weak and wavering, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it leaves us half in and half out of the arms of Truth: but the other makes us firm, conſtant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94275:17"/>
becauſe it puts us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly and intirely into its embraces.</p>
               <p>All thoſe times then which are ſo favourable, as to let your mind be free and unclog'd, ſpend ſome of your retired thoughts in the company of immaterial beings; and approach ſo near them that you even feel and handle them, and remain perſwaded they are no leſs real than thoſe which you ſee and hear and touch with your outward man. By which means they will infinitely more engage your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and tie your heart unto them, than any thing elſe can do; becauſe of the vaſt diſproportion which every one acknowledges (ſuppoſing their exiſtence) between them and all that you love in this ſenſible world.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Think firſt of all, that your Body is but the clothes and garments of your Soul, and that this indeed is the man. And undreſs your ſelf in your own thoughts, ſtrip your ſelf of theſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94275:17"/>
robes, and conceive that you are only a naked Spirit. This you can do; and thereby you will both make your Soul think more of it ſelf, and you will likewiſe plainly prove it is quite diſtinct from your body: in whoſe ſociety though it live, yet is not of its lineage, but of another nature and original: For nothing can think it ſelf not to be, ſince by its very think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, it proves that it hath a being. But we can quite put off all thoughts that we have this body hanging about us, and the Soul can think it ſelf to be what now it is, though it look not through theſe eyes, nor ſpeak with this tongue, nor write with theſe hands, nor have any other thing about it but its own thoughts: And therefore it is not ſuch a thing as this Body, but ſome better and more noble ſubſtance. It is that which tells you that you have a Body. If you believe it, you have reaſon to believe withal that it ſelf is ſome other being, of more force and longer continuance:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94275:18"/>
becauſe you can now think you have caſtoff your body and conceive it lying in the duſt, your ſoul ſtill remaining as it is, full of theſe and other ſuch like thoughts; but you can never think you have no ſoul, becauſe even by that conception you prove that you have, and ſhew your ſelf to be a thoughtful thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When you have thus therefore diſcourſed your ſelf into ſome feeling of your Soul, think in the next place very ſeriouſly, that whatſoever you clearly apprehend by this, though it be perceived by none of your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes, yet is no leſs real and certain than what you uſe with them. Disbelieve your eyes, and think that your ears bring you a falſe report, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than doubt of any thing which your mind doth plainly and diſtinctly perceive. Though you cannot but yield an aſſent to the relation which any of your ſenſes make you, yet ſince the mind is the more excellent Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94275:18"/>
and it hath a moſt certain exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, give the greateſt credit to what it affirms, when none of them can afford you any evidence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And then you will preſently find that your mind aſſerts nothing ſo ſtrongly, as the being of a God, without whom it could not be. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your ſelf therefore as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of him, as you do of that which your eyes behold. Though your eyes ſee him not as they do the Sun, yet ſay to your ſelf, my Soul doth; which gives as ſound an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on his behalf, as my eyes do for the Sun. That great Light, and all the reſt of thoſe Globes of Fire, which I ſee in the Skies, declare him as clearly to my mind, as they do themſelves to my outward Senſe. I cannot think of them, nor of my ſelf, nor of any thing elſe in this great World, but a Divine Being preſents it ſelf before me; by whoſe incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable wiſdom and Almighty good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94275:19"/>
they were at once produced, and ſet in this beautiful and uſeful order, in which I behold them. Exhort your ſelf therefore to look about you as often for this end, as you are apt to do for other little purpoſes, that you may ſee God in this goodly Temple, which he hath built him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for his own glory. Set your Soul in that Divine Preſence, which fills all things. Open your eares, liſten to the wide World, and hear (as <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nazianzen</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſpeaks) <hi>that great and admirable Preacher of his Majeſty.</hi>

and enjoy it ſelf, if he pleaſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Body; excite in your Soul a moſt paſſionate deſire to be ſo happy, that when it quits the place of its preſent abode, it may approach near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to his bleſſed Majeſty, and have a clearer ſight of his ſurpaſſing glory. Put your ſelf in hope alſo that his Divine Goodneſs, which hath plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in you ſuch ſtrong inclinations, and filled you with ſuch deſires, will not let them want the pleaſure of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Look up above, and think that when your Spirit ſhall take its flight from hence, there is ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Company to entertain it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World: whoſe acquaintance is far more deſirable than the ſociety of the deareſt Friend we have here, who perhaps as ſoon as he hath gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our love, takes his leave of us, and goes his way thither. What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort have we remaining in this, and other innumerable caſes, but the hope of Immortality? Which is the only thing that can raiſe our Spirit
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94275:20"/>
above the pleaſures and the troubles too of this mortal Body. This is our chiefeſt good, on which we ſhould ſet our heart. This is the inheritance to which we are born, (as <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſpeaks) and for which we are form'd by vertue and piety: the only inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, of which we can be ſecure that we ſhall never be defeated. For all this World we muſt leave behind us: we can carry nothing away with us, but an innocent and well-paſſed life, and the hopes which accompany it. <hi>He only comes to God rich and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and abounding in wealth</hi> (as his words are) <hi>whom continence, mercy, patience, charity and faith, ſhall attend and conveigh into his Preſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. To aſſure your ſelf therefore of this great good, on which our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſtrength and comfort relies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in the next place, that your mind plainly tells you (and its teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is indubitable) that God muſt needs be true, and that whatſoever
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94275:21"/>
he ſaith, ought immediately, without any heſitation, to be firmly believed. For as he can never be deceived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo we are ſure he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now God hath been pleaſed at laſt to ſpeak to us by his own dear Son, as a voice from Heaven, and a World of mighty deeds have teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>

                  <hi>but we know it from a Divine Tradition.</hi> It is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to us by the Son of God, who hath put an end to all diſputes, by coming from Heaven to us, with the Words of Eternal Life. Lay up his Words therefore moſt carefully in your heart, let them dwell richly and plentifully in you in all wiſdom; and poſſeſs you at once with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſenſe of God, and of the dignity of your Soul, and of Immortality, and of the Joy of the Inviſible World.</p>
               <p>The Benefits of this Exerciſe are ſo evident, that I may leave you to relate them, when you have felt them. It will be ſufficient for me to ſuggeſt to you, that the Heart muſt needs become by this means, very cold and dead to thoſe earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which were wont to bewitch and inchant it with their deceitful Pleaſures. If the Soul be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as the Platoniſts fancied) with
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94275:22"/>
as many Garments as there are Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, through which it paſſed as it deſcended into this Body, and if it be ſo mufled in them that it doth but fumble in its thoughts, and hath much ado to feel it ſelf; hereby it will be able in ſome meaſure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt it ſelf of thoſe thick Blankets, wherein it is wrapped, and throw off thoſe heavy coats that dangle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout its heeles, and incumber its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as it ſets its Feet forward to walk toward the Father of its Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is no contemptible diſcourſe which their Maſter makes concerning Felicity;<note place="margin">Plato in Phaedone.</note> which he rightly places in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and love of the Soveraign Good. How that no Man can attain unto it in this Life, by reaſon of the lumpiſh matter to which the Soul is faſt tyed, and by reaſon of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Worldly affairs which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire our attendance; yea, and of the fancies and toyes that will fill our thoughts, do what we can.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94275:23"/>
Whence he concludes, that either no Man ſhall be happy, (which he thinks is very abſurdly affirmed) or he muſt arrive at his Happineſs after he is dead. And if when we are dead (ſaith he) the Bleſſed Time is come, wherein we may enjoy, as we would, that greateſt good; then the nearer any Man approaches unto Death, the nearer he comes within the reach of his Felicity. If a Man therefore will with-draw Himſelf from the World, if he will abſtract his mind from ſenſible things, and take his heart from bodily pleaſures, and turn himſelf into himſelf (which they judged, as the Holy Writers do, a kind of Death) he ſhall be in the beginnings of his Happineſs. There I know, my Friend, you deſire to find your ſelf; and for that cauſe, I pray you learn thus to ſteal out of the company of Worldly things, which by hindring us from beginning our Happineſs, would keep us in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual miſery. Converſe, as often as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94275:23"/>
you can, with your nobler ſelf; and contract an intimate acquaintance with thoſe divine Inhabitants which are lodged there. Grow into an high eſteem of that unſeen Power, which knows God and the Life to come; which thinks, and guides, and gives orders, deſires, and loves, and doth all things elſe belonging to this Life. And calling to mind continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally its worth and dignity, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering for what heavenly enjoyments it was deſigned; diſdain to let it be condemned to ſo baſe a ſlavery, as to ſerve the Body only, and make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for its Luſts and Pleaſures. Reſcue it from that thraldome, and aſſert its liberty: which is no ſuch difficult undertaking; ſince rightly to underſtand it ſelf, is ſufficient for its ſafety and preſervation.</p>
               <p>And, to ſay the truth, the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of this Exerciſe is no leſs apparent than the <hi>benefit.</hi> We had need ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint our ſelves thoroughly with
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94275:24"/>
thoſe Spiritual and Heavenly Beings, and make them very familiar to us; becauſe theſe outward Objects are ſo near us, and have gained ſuch an intereſt in us, that, even when we are thinking of the other, they will buſily interpoſe themſelves, and are able in an inſtant to obtrude their Company, though then very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, upon us. How oft do our minds turn aſide to ſpeak with them, in the midſt of our Prayers? How will our thoughts be diſcompoſed at the ſound of a Bell, the creaking of a Door, the buzzing of a Fly, or ſome ſuch weak and contemptible thing, that affects our Senſes? When we are bowed down before God, when our Hands and Eyes are lifted up to Heaven, how doth the Memory of Yeſterdays enjoyments, or the fear of to Morrows troubles, (beſides the thoughts of the preſent Days buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) ſtart up and interrupt us, we know not how, or on what occaſion? The uneaſineſs of our bended Joynts,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94275:24"/>
the biting of a Flea, the prick of a Pin, ſome Word which we then ſpeak, any fancy that riſes up by the natural motion of our Spirits, will trouble our minds in our Devotion, and carry us away from God. It concerns us therefore very highly to work our minds into a ſtronger, and more delightful Senſe of Him, and of all Spiritual enjoyments, ſince our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with the other is ſo inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; that the very leaſt of them is in favour enough with us, to give us an avocation from this better Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, even when we are ingaged in it.</p>
               <p>In order to this, and all things elſe, you know very well how neceſſary it is to implore the aſſiſtance of Gods grace, and to beſeech his Infinite Goodneſs, that he will be pleaſed to repreſent himſelf, more clearly than you can do, unto your mind; and lift it up above toward the Happineſs of the other World: Which you may do in ſome ſuch words as theſe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>O</hi> God, I believe that thou art, and that nothing could have been without Thee: who filleſt all things, and art every where to be ſeen and felt by obſervant minds, who diligently ſeek Thee. Vouchſafe, I moſt humbly beſeech Thee, to behold a Soul that ſeriouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires towards Thee, and whom thou haſt already filled with earneſt deſires to be united in Eternal love to Thee; but is pulled down, alas! by this earthly body, and in danger to ſink, without thy migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty aides, into too great a love of theſe lower goods, which here ſurround me. Draw near, O Father of Spirits; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thy ſelf ſo clearly to me, and touch my mind with ſuch a powerful ſenſe of Thee, that it may be lifted up above all earthly things; and my heart may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways incline towards Thee, and be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with a conſtant and moſt ardent love of Thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:94275:25"/>Awaken in me, on all occaſions, a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remembrance of the worth and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, of that Immortal Spirit, which thou haſt breathed into me: And raiſe it up to as lively a belief, and hope of that Eternal bliſs, into which Jeſus our Lord is entred for us. Fix my mind upon that unſeen felicity, and keep it in ſuch a stedfaſt and delightful contemplation of it, that nothing here on Earth may be able to tempt me down into an inordinate deſire after it, and love unto it. O what glorious objects appear before me, ſurpaſſing all that mine eyes behold, now that my thoughts are retired a little from this outward World! O what ſhadows do all things here ſeem, in compare with thoſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly enjoyments which thou preſenteſt to me! What longings do I feel excited in my heart after Thee! What deſires to be always with thee, and to be filled still with a stronger ſenſe of Thee! O thou who art the beginner and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all goood, be pleaſed to aſſiſt my holy endeavours to withdraw my mind
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94275:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more and more from theſe ſenſible things, that it may have a clearer ſight of its Heavenly Country from whence it comes, and whither it deſires to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and there live for ever. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it thereby from the power of all temptations here; and enable me to prepare it, to be preſented unto Thee by my Saviour, adorned with that Faith, Purity, Patience, Righteouſneſs, Mercy, and ſuch like Heavenly qualities, as will diſpoſe me for the Company of the Bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>I ſigh to think, O my God, of the weakneſs of my mind, which is ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtracted and turned aſide in theſe my addreſſes to Thee. Pity me, good Lord; and knit my thoughts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to a cloſer attendance on Thee. Help me to gather my mind into it ſelf, and there to enjoy thy Divine Preſence with leſs diſturbance from this outward World. O that all things here may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bring thee to my mind, than carry it away from thee! Diſpoſe me ſo to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94275:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
obſerve the foot-ſteps of thy wiſe and mighty Goodneſs in all thy Creatures, that I may perpetually acknowledg thee; and then eſpecially be born away far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other things, in high admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Thee, and ſervent affection to Thee, when I am thus proſtrate in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble adoration of thy Divine Majeſty. And when I am ſo feeble, as to wander after little things, even while I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting my ſelf before thee, and offering my heart to thee; Help me to long the more earneſtly after that happy state, wherein I ſhall with more ſteady thoughts and intire devotion, give e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting praiſes to Thee.</p>

               <p>NOW that you may the better preſerve in your Soul theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſires, and that they may not dye for want of continual fewel to feed and nouriſh them, let me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you, <hi>My Friend,</hi> in the next place, to repreſent to your ſelf, as often, and as ſenſibly as you can, <hi>the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable greatneſs of that inviſible hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the World to come.</hi> In which that I may aſſiſt you, as much as I am able, I will direct you to ſuch an eaſy way of managing your thoughts that you may purſue this counſel with no great pains and labour. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin Martyr</hi> obſerves in his Dialogue with <hi>Trypho</hi> the Jew, that therefore God laid ſuch reſtraints upon that Nation, and forbad them, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the uſe of certain Meats, the oftner to put them in mind of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, even in the moſt common acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of humane life; and to make
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94275:27"/>
them remember they were under his Government, and ſubject to his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority, which they were too prone to forget. And will it not be a great ſhame, if in theſe riper Ages of the World, the free uſe that God hath given us of all things, ſhould not teach us as much as thoſe reſtraints and abridgments of their liberty did them, in the infancy of Divine knowledge? Ill natures are taught moſt by their wants, but the good are beſt inſtructed by their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments. Ingrateful People think of God, when he takes away his bleſſings from them; but ingenuous and thankful minds have a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to him, when his favours are in their hands. Nor do they only think it a duty, but feel it a pleaſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the bounty of their great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor: which endeares the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of it, and makes it ſtill both more facile and more frequent. In ſo much that in the uſe of all theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and carnal things, a pious heart
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94275:28"/>
may ſoon learn to turn its thoughts, and raiſe up its affections, to a more ſpiritual good, and nobler fruitions. Do you not obſerve how the Holy Ghoſt is wont to expreſs the joyes of the World to come, by ſuch pleaſures as are moſt acceptable to us here? What is the reaſon of it, if it be not in compaſſion to the weakneſs of our apprehenſions; and to let us ſee that all bodily delights adminiſter occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for pious thoughts, and holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after diviner enjoyments? God would preſerve us from ſinking into a fleſhly ſenſe, by our daily converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with, and uſe of fleſhly things. He ſhows us how we may lift up our minds, even by thoſe things which are apt to depreſs them; and take an advantage from theſe inferiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, to climb up towards thoſe higher ſatisfactions. Hence it is that the happy enjoyments of the other World are compared ſo often to the pleaſures of <hi>eating and drinking,</hi> whereby our hunger and thirſt is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94275:28"/>
aſſwaged, and our bodily life ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. Yea, to a <hi>Feaſt;</hi> which is a more liberal entertainment of that kind, and is the meaning of that phraſe in the Goſpel, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents <hi>Lazarus</hi> carried by Angels into <hi>Abrahams boſome;</hi> placed, that is, in the uppermoſt Room at that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Feaſt, and treated as the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and moſt beloved gueſt. Yea, to a <hi>Marriage-Feaſt;</hi> which being a time of the greateſt joy, Men are wont to make the largeſt proviſion of good chear, that their friends may rejoyce together with them. And laſtly to a <hi>Marriage-Feaſt made by a King;</hi> a Royal entertainment, ſuch as a Monarch would make at the Wedding of his Son. All which may ſerve to provoke good minds to look up above ſuch things as theſe, which are moſt enticing in this World, and to be ſo far from being ſwallowed up in ſenſual pleaſures, as to give themſelves thereby a more lively taſte of that exceſſive joy
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94275:29"/>
which God will impart unto them, when they ſhall live with him, and be feaſted by him in his Heavenly Kingdom. The like benefit you may reap from all other things which you converſe withall; and though the World will attract your thoughts to it, and imploy a great many of your hours; yet you may draw at laſt ſomething from thence, which will pay you well for the time which you have ſpent upon it. As for Example, when you look about you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the delightful Objects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you are inviron'd on every ſide, which preſent themſelves continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to your Eyes, or your Eares, or your Taſt, or other of your Senſes, you may think with your ſelf,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If God have provided ſuch a multitude of pleaſant things for the entertainment of this poor body in this preſent life; What are the joys and delights, which he hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for my better part in the life
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94275:29"/>
which is to come? This is the World of Bodies, the other of Souls and Spirits. Therefore if this little Carkaſe, which is but as the Graſs of the Field, be ſo well accomodated, if there be ſo many rare things in the Earth, and the Sea, and the Air for its refreſhment and pleaſure; What may I not expect hereafter for my mind in thoſe Celeſtial, thoſe ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Regions which I ſee above? O the inconceivable felicity which is provided in the Paradiſe of God, for this more wide and capacious Spirit, which beares his own Image, and like himſelf, is to live for ever!</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, you may think with your ſelf, if there be ſuch pleaſure to be found in a Creature, O what is there then in the Creator of all? If the ſight of the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, and all the reſt of the beauties of this World be ſo glorious; What will it be to ſee my God? to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with that wiſdom which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94275:30"/>
and with that goodneſs which produced this vaſt, this goodly and comely Fabrick? If the melodies of Muſick be ſo charming; O what an ecſtaſie of joy will it caſt me into, to hear God himſelf ſay, I love thee, I delight in thee for ever? If the love of a true Friend do ſo much raviſh and tranſport my Spirit; what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is it that I ſhall feel, when my Soul ſhall love him as much as its moſt enlarged Powers will enable it; and know how much I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by him? There is a delicious Meditation in St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; who thus ſpeaks to God in one of his Confeſſions.<note place="margin">

                  <q>I love thee, O my God; thou haſt ſmitten my heart with thy Word and I have loved thee. Nay, the Heavens and the Earth, and all things contained therein, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh me on every ſide, that I ſhould love thee; and they ceaſe not to ſay the ſame to all Men elſe, ſo that they are inexcuſable, if they do not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94275:30"/>
love thee. But what do I love, when I love thee? Not the beauty of a Body; not the grace and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of time; not the brightneſs of light (and yet, O how friendly and agreeable is that to theſe eys!) not the ſweet melodies of well-compoſed Songs; not the fragrant odors of Flowers, or unguents, or coſtly Spices; not Manna; not Honey; not the embraces of the deareſt, and moſt lovely Perſon: theſe are not the things that I love, when I love my God. And yet I love a certain light, and a certain voice, and a certain grateful odor, and a certain food, and a kind of embracement when I love my God; the true light, the melody, the food, the ſatisfaction and the embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my inward man. Where that ſhines to my Soul, which no place can contain; where that ſounds, which no time can ſnatch away; where that ſcents, which no Wind can diſperſe and ſcatter
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94275:31"/>
abroad; where I taſte that which eating cannot diminiſh; where I cleave to that, which no fulneſs, no ſatiety can force away. This is that which I love, when I love my God. And what is this? I askt the Earth, and it ſaid, I am not. I askt the Sea, and the Deeps and all living Creatures, and they anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, We are not thy God; look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove us, and enquire after him, for here he is not. I askt the Air, and all its Inhabitants, yea, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and they confeſſed, We are not him whom thy Soul ſeeketh. And I ſpake to all things whatſoever, that ſtand round about the Gates of my Fleſh, ſaying; Ye tell me that ye are not my God, but tell me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of him. And they all cried out with a loud voice, <hi>He made us.</hi>
                  </q> Look therefore how great, how goodly, how glorious, how beautiful and pleaſant we are; and he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more bright, more ſweet,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94275:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more harmonious, more filling and contenting than the whole World, which is but his Creature.</p>
               <p>And having thus a little raiſed up your mind above all things viſible, you may proceed to a new Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this manner.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If a Soul incloſed in this Body can ſee and apprehend ſo much of God; O what a ſight of him ſhall it have, when it is freed from theſe Chaines? If whilſt we look out of theſe Windowes of Senſe, ſuch a glorious Majeſty preſents it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; in what an amazing ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor will the Divinity appear, when there is nothing to interpoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, and its incomparable beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? If whilſt there are ſo many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things to imploy our thoughts, he diſcover ſo much of himſelf to us, What will he do when we ſhall be alone with Him, and ſeeing face to face, ſhall know as we are known?
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94275:32"/>
Is it not a Miracle to ſee ſo much light conveyed to us, through ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a hole as that of the eye? to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſo much of the Heaven and the Earth at once, and ſuch a company of beautiful objects crowding in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at ſo narrow a paſſage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſturbance or diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? O what an admirable pleaſure then (as <hi>Seneca</hi> diſcourſes with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) will the Soul be ſurpriſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, when it ſhall come into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of light? when it ſhall be all ſurrounded with this glorious Body? when on every ſide, as we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, it ſhall take in light, and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned and clothed with it, as with a Garment? And may we not with greater reaſon meditate on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when we think of God the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of light, and of all thoſe goodly things which it diſcovers to us? Ought we not to ſay to our ſelves; O what wiſdom, what greatneſs, what riches of goodneſs is this, which ſhowes it ſelf in all his works of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94275:32"/>
wonder? What a World of things hath he compriſed in this one little Being, which calls it ſelf Man? whoſe mind is circumſcribed, and yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelf beyond the limits of this ſenſible World? which remaining in this body, ſwiftly runs and takes its circuit, and views all Creatures in Heaven and Earth? and united to theſe Senſes, abſtracts it ſelf from them, and goes to the Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; whom it meets with every where? Is it thus active, thus buſie, thus capacious &amp; diſcerning, whilſt it is thruſt up in ſuch a cloſe and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Room, as this poor Body, and ſhall it not be more vigorous, more piercing, more inlarged, when it is ſet at liberty from this impriſonment? It will then ſure ſtretch it ſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more of him; it will ſee him more clearly, and comprehend him more fully, &amp; admire him with more improved and extended thoughts, and love him with a more ardent flame, and feel more of his wiſdome,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94275:33"/>
more of his goodneſs preſſing in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and filling of it with infinite joy and ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Again, you may think with your ſelf, if God beſtow ſo many goodly things even upon the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then what ſhall be the portion of the juſt? Do not the worſt of men poſſeſs great plenty of his bleſſings? Doth he not entertain them here with ſtrange variety of delicious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments? Are they not ſo liberally and abundantly provided for, that Silver and Gold and Jewels are theirs? and all Creatures in the Earth, and the Air, and the Water are preſſed for their Service? O what Treaſures, what Riches of Glory, what exceſs of Joy then will God confer on thoſe who are moſt dear unto Him? If he treat his Enemies in this manner, how ſumptuouſly will he entertain his Friends? If he let ſuch Rebels live in a Palace ſo ſtately, ſo richly furniſht, as this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94275:33"/>
great World is, which he hath built for good and bad; what Manſions may we think are thoſe, which are peculiarly prepared for them, who live in faithful obedience to him?</p>
               <p n="5">5. And think again, if God hath made this Building wherein we dwell ſo ſumptuous, though it be to continue but for a time; O how glorious are thoſe Manſions which are Eternal in the Heavens? If he hath beſtowed ſo much coſt on that which waxeth old, and ſhall vaniſh away, what are the Ornaments of that which ſhall never decay? Is not this very mortal Body which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit very fearfully and wonderfully made? Is it not contrived with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable art, and curiouſly wrought in the lowermoſt parts of this little World? O how beautiful then will that Body be which is from Heaven, and ſhall never be diſſolved, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Immortal there? With what luſtre ſhall we ſhine when this vile
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94275:34"/>
Body ſhall be changed, and made like to the glorious Body of Chriſt our Lord?</p>
               <p n="6">6. And cannot you eaſily make your ſelf believe the inconceivable ſplendor of that place where God himſelf more particularly dwells, ſince he hath made for us ſo fair and goodly an Habitation? Heaven you know, is called his <hi>dwelling-place;</hi> and our bleſſed Lord calls it his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Houſe,</hi> where there are many Manſions for all his beloved Ones. O how beautiful, how glorious, how full of Majeſty muſt this needs be; ſeeing we, and other of his lower Creatures live in a World which is ſo richly adorned, and ſo fairly beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified both above and beneath? Do you not ſee how the roof of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace (if I may ſo ſpeak) wherein we are, is all gilded with innumerable Stars? how the Floor of it is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid with wonderful variety of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Plants and lovely Flowers? O

how gliſtering, O how refulgent then is that place, may you think with your ſelf, in which the Lord of Heaven and Earth himſelf is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in a ſpecial manner, to reſide? where he keeps his Court; where all the Angels miniſter to Him; where he ſhows the Greatneſs of his Glory, and where our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſits at the Right Hand of the Throne of that Majeſty on High?</p>
               <p n="7">7. And when was it that he brought you into this delightful Dwelling; ſo rarely furniſh'd and richly adorn'd? Was it not as ſoon as you were born; before you could know to whom you were beholden, or could give him any proof of your love and fidelity? Think with your ſelf then, and ſay, If God hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us ſuch a World of good things by way of gift, O what is that which he will beſtow, when he ſhall come to reward? If before we do our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to him, I mean, he is ſo bountiful,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94275:35"/>
nay, opens his Hand ſo wide, and fills every living thing with good, though they cannot acknowledg him; what bleſſings will he pour forth, what liberality will he expreſs, when he comes to recompence our faithful ſervices, and give us according to our works? For we ſee that gracious Princes, who grant many immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and priviledges to their ſubjects, only becauſe they are their ſubjects, do not fail to raiſe and advance their good and valiant ſubjects, who have performed ſome noble acts in their ſervice, to eminent Honours and High Places. Now ſince that which God will beſtow in the Life to come, though it be a free gift, yet, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Reward and Recompence, praiſe and commendation, you may well think it will be very illuſtrious; when you conſider how rich in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy he hath been to us, before we could do any thing praiſe-worthy.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And you may conſider again,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94275:35"/>
how that excellent Princes, when they give rewards, are not wont to have reſpect ſo much to the Perſons on whom they are conferred (who may be but mean, and of low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) as to the greatneſs of their own Perſons, by whom they are beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whom it doth not befit to give any thing mean and below the name and the Authority which they bear. From whence you may conclude, how inconceivably great that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward will be, which the Majeſty of Heaven and Earth will honour us withall. If a Prince do but ſend his Charity to the Poor, it is not like one of us, but like himſelf; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch will the favours of God be, which he intends to deal to all his Servants. Though they are but ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, though they are but unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſervants, and have done no more than was their duty to do; yet he will reward them like a King, like the King of all the World, like the bleſſed and only Potentate, the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94275:36"/>
King of Kings, and the Lord of Lords, who only hath immortality. He will feaſt and entertain them ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to the excellence of his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Majeſty, and not proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the poverty of their Perſons, or of their deſerts.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For you may conſider again, that it is the reward which the Lord Jeſus hath received, to give us, for all his pains, and tears, and ſweat, and blood. It is the purchaſe of the blood of the Son of God, the recompence of his obedience to the death; and therefore muſt needs be of great and ineſtimable price.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Nay, it is the glory of Chriſt himſelf, the ſame happineſs which he enjoys; according to his own words, <hi>The glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them,</hi> and <hi>enter thou into the joy of thy Lord:</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of St. <hi>Paul, We are Heirs of God, Co-heirs with Chriſt Jeſus;</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:94275:36"/>
who is gone into the Heavens, as he told his Apoſtles, <hi>to prepare a place for us.</hi> To prepare a place for us, you may ſay? How long will it be a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? When ſhall we come to it?</p>
               <p n="11">11. Truly, from thence you may take ſome eſtimate of it; by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the time you muſt ſtay and wait till your happineſs be compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that is till the Day of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing again unto Salvation. They are great things, which are long in preparing. And therefore the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er your Life is hid with God in Chriſt, (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks) the more glorious will it appear, when it ſhall be manifeſted. The longer your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſleeps in the duſt, to the greater dignity ſhall it be raiſed. God will pay us (if I may ſo ſpeak) principal and uſe, and all. The Treaſure mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies, the longer it lies in his hands. If he ſhould give us our reward now it could be but little: but it increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes infinitely, beyond all our thoughts
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94275:37"/>
by being depoſited with him, till the Lord Jeſus ſhall come from Heaven, with all his mighty Angels, <hi>to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired in his Saints, and glorified in all them that believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. And now in Concluſion, think with your ſelf, what a pleaſure theſe ſhort and little thoughts have given you; how delightful that minute is, in which you have had a glance of your future happineſs; and ſay to your ſelf, if a ſmall taſt be ſo ſweet, O what will the full draughts be, when he makes me drink of the Rivers of his Pleaſure? Are not Men of contemplation wonderouſly tranſported with ſome few diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which they have made, of the ſecrets of nature? Are they not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually thirſting and ſeeking after more? Do they not ſpend their time and their eſtates in ſuch enquiries, though they never hope to find out all? What would not theſe Men give, (were it in their power) if the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94275:37"/>
earth, or any other part of this world, would reveal all the Treaſures that are hid in it? What a ſatisfaction would they eſteem ſuch a vaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, when ſome little ſcraps of knowledge are ſo ſurprizing? The ſame you may think of the other World; and raiſe your ſpirit by ſuch Meditations as theſe, to expect an inconceivable joy, when all the glory of that ſhall be opened, which now darts ſuch chearful Rayes of Light into your mind. <hi>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, we are now the Sons of God, but it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be. But we know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> What that will be we cannot tell: but we feel now how delicious it is to reſemble him, though but a little, in his Wiſdome, in his Goodneſs, in his Love and Charity, in his Meekneſs and Patience, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:94275:38"/>
ſuch like Heavenly qualities: And if in a drop of Honey, that diſtills from above, there be ſuch ſweetneſs, what ſatisfaction, what fulneſs of joy ſhall we find, in an Ocean of pleaſure? If the morning ſtar be ſo bright, then what is the Sun it ſelf, in its greateſt luſtre? It is one of the Meditations of St. <hi>Auſtin; O God, if thou doſt ſuch great things for us in the Priſon, what wilt thou do for us in the Palace? If thou granteſt ſuch ſolace in the day of our tears, what wilt thou give us on the day of our marriage?</hi> When we ſhall not only behold Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in all his glory; but live with him, and live with him for ever, and receive the utmoſt effects of his mighty love, and be preferred to ſit with him in Heavenly places, and have a Crown of Righteouſneſs ſet on our Heads, which he the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judg will give to all thoſe, <hi>who love his appearing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is there not great reaſon, <hi>My
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94275:38"/>
Friend,</hi> that we ſhould love it, and ſet our hearts on this, as the moſt deſirable good; which ſo far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes all others, that they have no power at all to tempt us from it, while we keep in mind its incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable greatneſs? Perſwade your ſelf therefore as ſtrongly as you can, that Jeſus lives; and that <hi>becauſe he lives you ſhall live alſo;</hi> and that you ſhall live with him in inconceivable bliſs, according to his gracious promiſes. Believe them heartily, fix them deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in your mind, and by ſuch arts as theſe repreſent to your ſelf, as ſenſibly as you can, how exceeding precious they are: for it is neither the certainty, nor the goodneſs, nor the greatneſs of any thing, but the lively faith which we have of it implanted in our Souls, that will make us ſeek and labour for it. If our faith be ſuperficial, we ſhall be no more moved by it, than if it were a thing of little moment, or but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed tale, and ſome idle fancy. You
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94275:39"/>
muſt ſettle in your Soul therefore, I ſay again, an unmoveable belief of Chriſts great and precious promiſes, and preſent them to your heart, that it may be affected with them, and value them, according to their worth. Then you will not be unwilling to do, nor backward to ſuffer any thing, that he would have you. This will give you a great ſpirit and courage and joy in both. You will take a great pleaſure in godlineſs, which hath ſuch a recompenſe of reward. Nay, all the afflictions of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time will ſeem inconſiderable, in compare with the glory that ſhall be revealed. Can any heart think much to abſtain a while from ſinful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, when he believes, nay taſtes the pleaſures he ſhall ſhortly enjoy at Gods right hand? Will not any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous deſires be content to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, when you ſee it is for a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and a Crown of Life? Of what ſhould a Soul be ambitious beſide whoſe deſires are pitcht upon ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94275:39"/>
a good, as honour, glory, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality with Chriſt? Who would not watch and pray unweariedly, that he may come to this Celeſtial Reſt with the People of God? Can there be any higher pleaſure, than to lift up our mind to our heavenly Country, and to think of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which there expects us? In what can we better ſpend our time, than in meditating of the great love of God, which hath prepared ſuch excellent things for thoſe that love him? It is a good thing ſure to give thanks unto the Lord, and to ſing praiſes unto his high and holy Name. There can be no more delicious life than this, which will conclude in his everlaſting praiſes. And ſuppoſe we muſt ſometime take up a croſs, where is the miſchief of it, what ſhould render it intolerable, if we <hi>look at Jeſus, who for the joy that was ſet before him endured the Croſs, and deſpiſing the ſhame, is ſet down at the right hand of the Throne of God?</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:94275:40"/>
From thence he ſtretches forth his hands to call us; there his Armes are open to embrace us; and there he would gladly ſee us. Out of that glorious place he holds forth a crown of life to us, ſaying; Follow me, and let none of theſe things diſmay you. Behold the Majeſty, wherein I am enthroned; ſee the glory to which I am promoted; Do not faint in your mind, nor be weary of well-doing; but preſs on towards the mark, for the prize of the high-call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, in me your Saviour.</p>
               <p>There is nothing ſure can hinder us, or pull us back, unleſs we ceaſe to <hi>look at Jeſus,</hi> and turn away our Eares from hearkning to his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous voice. For do you not ſee what power a worldly faith hath over Mens hearts? How faſt one rides to take poſſeſſion of an Eſtate, of which he hears he is left the Heir? How another ſailes through dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dangers, becauſe he believes he
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94275:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhall arrive at a rich Country; which will ſend him home laden with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Commodities at the laſt? Why ſhould we think then the Chriſtian Faith is leſs powerful, or fancy that we are in truth indued with it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs our belief of the other World have the ſame effects? Let it lay its commands upon all the powers of our Soul, and engage them to do their ſeveral works. Let it excite our minds, and our wills, and our affections, and our endeavours, to a conſtant purſuit of theſe Heavenly enjoyments; that we may know indeed, that we <hi>believe to the ſave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Soul.</hi> Look upon that faith which was built on weaker grounds and leſſer evidences, and darker pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. See how it wrought in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and in the reſt of the ancient Patriarchs; whoſe belief of the Word of God made them forſake their own Countries, quit all their Poſſeſſions, when he required it, live as Pilgrims and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94275:41"/>
ſtrangers in the Earth, and depend meerly on the love and care of his never failing providence. By faith they ſlighted the pleaſures of Kings Courts, the Honour of a Throne, and the Riches of <hi>Egypt.</hi> By Faith they wrought Righteouſneſs, ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Kingdomes, ſtopped the mouths of Lyons, indured all reproaches and afflictions, would not accept of deliverance, and life it ſelf, that they might obtain a better Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Now ſince the Chriſtian Belief relies upon better Promiſes, a clearer Revelation, and ſtronger grounds of hope, by the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus from the dead; what a ſhame will it be, if we do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy the name of Men, much leſs of the Diſciples of Chriſt, and of the Sons of God? To what cauſe can it be imputed, but becauſe there is no Faith in the Earth, or it reſts only in the brain, and floats in the imagination, but never deſcends to touch the heart and affections.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94275:41"/>
Bring it down then, <hi>My Friend,</hi> and ſtir up your ſelf to a ſerious and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate belief of the life to come. Spare no pains to conſider, and lay to heart (that which is the greateſt comfort of your life) all the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things which you read of in the Goſpel of Gods grace; which Chriſt hath ſealed by his blood, and God confirmed by his Reſurrection, and hath been atteſted by ſigns and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Holy Ghoſt, and by the Life and Death of a number of great Souls; who have followed Jeſus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to his Croſs, and declared their belief of thoſe things by ſacrificing all that was dear unto them here, to win his favour in another World. Look often upon their conſtancy, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their zeal, upon their contempt of Riches and Pleaſures, and Life it ſelf, when it came in competition with the will of Chriſt; for whoſe ſake they rejoyced that they were accounted worthy to ſuffer, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince he had aſſured them, their
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94275:42"/>
preſent troubles ſhould work for them a far more exceeding and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weight of glory. And then in imitation of them, you will put on their reſolution; and lifting up your Eyes to Heaven, will be moved to ſpeak to this effect. <q>O bleſſed God, how much am I beholden to thee, that thou haſt ſhewed me ſuch things as theſe! How much am I beholden to thee, that thou haſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined my heart to make them my choice! I would not be as I was before, for all the World. Away you frivolous temptations; you vain delights, you unprofitable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: Never renew your impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, for I will not hearken; I tell you, I will not liſten to you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more. I am reſolved to proceed in this holy courſe to the end of my days. You will but make me meditate the more; and pray the more; and lay to heart the more the love of my God: I ſhall but fix my Eyes the more ſtedfaſtly on
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94275:42"/>
that bleſſed place where Jeſus my Saviour is at Gods right hand. At his will I hold my riches, my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, yea, and my life alſo. Let him diſpoſe of them as he pleaſes. And let it pleaſe the Lord of life and glory to accept of this moſt hearty oblation which I make of all I have unto him. Let it pleaſe him to ſtrengthen me in my holy reſolutions, to open my eyes, that I may ſtill ſee more of that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful love which he hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in his Goſpel, and to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me with his grace, till I arrive at his heavenly Court. O let his good Spirit breath upon me, and carry away my Soul in holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires towards him. Let it guide my courſe through this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Sea wherein I am toſſed: Let it ſhine upon me, and proſper my endeavours: Let it bring me ſafely to a quiet haven in Eternal Reſt and Peace.</q>

The poor Norwegian, whom ſtories tell of, was afraid to touch Roſes, when he firſt ſaw them, for fear they ſhould burn his Fingers. He much wondered to ſee that Trees (as he thought) ſhould put forth flames and bloſſomes of Fire: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which he held up his hands to warm himſelf, not daring to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach any nearer. But as he you may be ſure was happily undeceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he came not only to touch, but likewiſe to ſmell thoſe innocent Flowers, which ſeemed to burn in his eyes: ſo will it be with us, when we come rightly to underſtand and feel the pleaſure that Religion gives us; which at firſt ſight, before we come acquainted with it, looks as if it intended to make us Martyrs, but not to crown us with any joys or contentments. As the Martyr ſaid of the real, fire, wherein he was covered, that it ſeemed to him, as if it were a Bed of Roſes; ſo ſhall we ſay of true Religion, which we
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94275:46"/>
are afraid will ſcorch us, and prove too hot for us: Its flames are but the flames of love; and it makes us not lye down in ſorrow, but in the moſt comfortable ſenſe of the tender love of our deareſt Lord.</p>
               <p>Think with your ſelf therefore, when you go into your Cloſet, and betake your ſelf to your private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements, I am going to God, my exceeding joy, to my happineſs, to my hearts delight.

When we repreſent him to our ſelves, as exceeding angry at every little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition and dulneſs that ſeiſes on us, that very thought makes us more dull and indiſpoſed; becauſe we i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that we ſhall never be able to pleaſe him. Or if we deem him, though not implacable yet, much in love with revenge, and ready to ſtrike upon every offence that we give him, I know no readier way to render his ſervice a moſt tedious
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94275:47"/>
task unto us; becauſe we ſhall go in perpetual fear of thunderbolts hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over our heads, and ready to fall down to do ſome miſchief or other to us. As we ought to have a great and ſcrupulous care to avoid all that is evil, ſo we muſt believe, when we commit a fault againſt our will and deſign, that there is an Advocate with our Father, who is a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our ſins. And when we look upon him thus, as one ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, that had rather do us all good than any harm, and deſires rather to ſee his commands better obſerved, than the penalties, for the breach of them, inflicted; this will incourage us to addreſs our ſelves with a freſh chearfulneſs to his ſervice; and breed in our hearts a great love to him, which above all other things hath a moſt powerful hand upon our obedience.</p>
               <p>The more you heighten your love to God, the more motion and activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94275:48"/>
will the heat of it give you: and the more you heighten his love to you, the greater flames will there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in your heart to him. Juſt as you ſee the Sun in its neareſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to us, when its beames are directly over our heads, produces a vigorous heat and life in all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but when it is in the Southern Countries, and looks upon us with an oblique aſpect, is not able to make us warm by its rayes: So it is with the Divine Goodneſs, which is the life and comfort of our hearts. If we think that he looks aſquint upon us, and cares very little for us, we ſhall be cold and frozen, like ſo many dead Creatures, in our affections to him; but if we think his face is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and that his eye, and the light of his countenance (as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks) is full upon us, that he highly favours us, and his heart is very deſirous to pour down a world of bleſſings into us; it will make our Souls leap for joy, our love will
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94275:48"/>
ſpring up apace, and the odors of it will be like the ſmell of Spices, ſweet both to God and to our ſelves. We love God commonly (if not always) in the beginning of our friendſhip with him, becauſe of the good that he doth, or that we think he will do to us: and though afterward this breeds a ſtrong inclination in us to love that moſt excellent Nature from which all good comes, yet that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination will ſtill grow ſtronger, by the continued thoughts of his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us. And therefore this belief is, by all means, to be nouriſhed and preſerved in our hearts; eſpecially conſidering that the ſtronger our love and inclination towards him grows, by frequent reflecting upon his love and good will to us, the more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and conſtant obedience ſhall we pay to him.</p>
               <p>I have repreſented this ſo largely in another Diſcourſe, (which you know very well) that it may ſeem
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94275:49"/>
unneceſſary to add any thing to it it here: But it will not be unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table I am ſure, to recommend to you this one conſideration more. That the hearty love of God (which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſprings out of a ſtedfaſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable belief of his love to us) is a thing ſo comprehenſive and ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>erful, that it includes in it all the means which are neceſſary for the accompliſhment of our end; and contains the force of all thoſe rules, helps and furtherances, which are commonly preſcribed for the better obſerving of Gods commands. Let me inſtance in theſe <hi>Five</hi> great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, to which you are often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted, both in Sermons and good Books, for the preſerving you in his Obedience: Firſt, <hi>To live, as in Gods ſight.</hi> Secondly, <hi>To pray continually.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>To watch.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>To depend on God for his aſſistance.</hi> And, Fifthly, <hi>To look for his mercy to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life:</hi> and plainly ſhow you that they are all comprehended in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94275:49"/>
Love, and cannot be ſeparated from it.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>first,</hi> it is well known that this paſſion is not wont to let the Object on which it is fixed be abſent from it; but at whatſoever diſtance it be removed, love brings it near, and ſets it ever before the eyes of him, to whom it is dear. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if our hearts be full of love to God, we cannot be without his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but ſhall live as in his ſight: Or, to ſpeak in the language of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 16.8. <hi>We ſhall ſet the Lord always before us.</hi> Whatſoever we do, we ſhall think of him; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently do it well and exactly: we ſhall ſtudy purity of heart, and the greateſt clearneſs in our intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; becauſe he ſees us, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates into our ſecret thoughts. There is no more eaſie obſervation than this, that nothing makes a Man ſo diligent, ſo curious, ſo circumſpect, ſo decent and comely in all his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94275:50"/>
as to be continually under the eye of one whom he loves; to whom he deſires, every way, to approve himſelf. And it is as certain, that ardent love makes a Perſon ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to us, and will not let us be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from him.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Phidias,</hi> the famous ſtatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, made the Image of <hi>Jupiter Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> one of the goodlieſt that ever was, he could not forbear, but he muſt privately ingrave upon his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Finger, the Name of one whom he dearly loved, in theſe words; PANTARCES IS FAIR.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> For it was not <hi>Jupiter</hi> (ſaith <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> from whom I have this ſtory) who was fair in <hi>Phidias</hi> his eyes, but the youth whom he loved. The thoughts of his God could not put out of his mind, the thoughts of him, whom he loved better. If therefore we had ſuch a love to God, as others have to the things of this World;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94275:50"/>
the thoughts of them could not quite thruſt out the thoughts of him. But ſtill we ſhould be apt to write (if I may ſo ſpeak) upon the very fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of every earthly good, <hi>God is most lovely:</hi> or, <hi>God is my exceeding joy; the Lord is my portion; O how amiable are his Courts!</hi> or as an holy man (who it is ſaid could never get theſe words out of his mouth) <hi>My God and all things.</hi> Where he is, there, in effect, are all things: and where his love dwells, there he will be ſure to be. We ſhall meet him every where, ſee him in every beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful thing, and taſte him, before we have done, in all the delightful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of this life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as it comprehends in it the practice of making God preſent (which ſome Maſters in Divinity have ſaid may ſerve inſtead of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rules, for the ordering of our life aright:) ſo it contains in it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the very ſpirit of <hi>Prayer to God;</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:94275:51"/>
which all acknowledg to be not only a great part of a godly life, but a great help and furtherance to us, in all the reſt of our Chriſtian duty. If by Prayer we underſtand, as ſome have explained it, the aſcent, or rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up of the Soul to God, it is love only which continually aſpires to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and carries the heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, from other things, to be joyned to him. Or if we call it the converſe of the Soul with God, (which are the words of <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi>) or a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conference and diſcourſe with the Divine Majeſty, (as it is termed by S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) it is manifeſt the love of God includes this in it: for it is the nature of this paſſion, to make us frequent the company of thoſe whom we love. Their converſation is moſt welcome; their diſcourſe delightful; we are exceedingly deſirous to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part our mind to them; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to let them know how much we love them. For which purpoſe it needs not alwayes the help of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94275:51"/>
tongue, but can frame a language of its own; and ſpeak by the very countenance and the eyes, and make uſe of ſilence inſtead of words to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare its inclinations. According to the admirable expreſſion of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, who, ſetting forth the pious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the People to God their Deliverer, ſaith, <hi>Praiſe is ſilent for thee, O God, in Sion</hi> (ſo the <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath it, as your Margin tells you) <hi>to Thee ſhall the vow be performed.</hi> But let us take it ſimply for the deſiring and requeſting good things of God, and then we muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that love being a paſſion full of deſires, cannot but comprehend in it (as I ſaid at firſt) the very ſpirit of Prayer and Supplication. You know how much we long for that, to which we have given our hearts. And therefore if they be devoted in love to God, we cannot chuſe but be ever breathing after more ſenſible apprehenſions and taſtes of him. So much as we love him, ſo much we
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94275:52"/>
ſhall thirſt after a larger communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Divine Grace to us. It will make us ſigh for more tokens of his favour; and wait for a greater power of his Holy Spirit; and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently long to be more transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and changed into his Image. What was it but this, that made <hi>David</hi> ſay, Pſal. 42.1. <hi>As the Hart panteth after the Water-brooks, ſo pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth my Soul after thee, O God?</hi> The chaſed Deer in a great Forreſt, and in the midſt of Summer did not more long after the ſtreames of Water, than this good Man (being it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Judah,</hi> and ſo denyed the favour of going to the Tabernacle of God) did ardently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the happineſs which there he had ſometime taſted in the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. He opens his mouth, and pants after this with a thirſt ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it makes him cry out in the following words, <hi>O when ſhall I come and appear before God?</hi> It is the heat of that Creature (to whoſe pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94275:52"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> compares the longings of his Soul) which is the cauſe of its thirſt; and that being a conſtant deſire, which goes not off by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, as many inconveniences do, but rather more encreaſes, it beares the greater reſemblance to this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine paſſion of love; whoſe fervours and ardent longings are perpetual, and do not abate by length of time, but grow ſtill greater and greater. There is nothing ſo likely as this, to enable us to fulfil that exhortation of the Apoſtle, <hi>Pray without ceaſing,</hi> and to make us importunate and unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in it; which are the two quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications our Saviour requires in our devout addreſſes to God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.1. Where you read a Parable of his to this end, that <hi>Men ought alwayes to pray, and not faint.</hi> It marvelouſly diſpoſes us alſo for the Divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by moving us to quit all that is inconſiſtent with our deſires, in hope of that which we pray God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon us. There was a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94275:53"/>
you have heard perhaps, who offered his Kingdome for a Cup of cold Water, in a time of extreme thirſt. And therefore what is it which the heat of this heavenly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection will not make us reſign to God and abſolutely part withall, that it may obtain its Petitions, and have its deſires ſatisfied? Beſides it hath one wonderful power in it (which nothing elſe can furniſh us withall) to make our Prayers prevalent; and that is by fixing our thoughts, and faſtning our minds to the buſineſs which we are about. For love, you know, doth not willingly ſtir from the Object to which it is devoted. It is this flame which keeps our heart cloſe to the Holy Sacrifice, and will not eaſily ſuffer us to wander from the Gate of Heaven. It ſets us in the Preſence of God; it keeps our eye upon him; it makes us converſe attentively with him; and while the power of it laſts, our very hearts are tyed to him, and cannot go aſide
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94275:53"/>
from him. But as ſoon as ever it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to dye or decay, then it is that the mind ſteales away, and gads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the World; till this flame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive again, and make us fly back to the Altar of God. The beſt Soul that is, I confeſs, may feel ſome looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſtraction of ſpirit; (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at ſome untoward ſeaſon) ſome aſhes may dim and dull the Fire: but yet this love and ardent deſire will keep the greater part of our thoughts together, and knit our heart ſo to our duty, that there ſhall be no long nor wide breaches in it; but it ſhall ſtill be ſtrong, and fervent, and effectual with our Heavenly Father.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how wiſely theſe two are joyned together by St. <hi>Jude, v.</hi> 20. Who after he had exhorted the Faithful to <hi>Pray in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> immediately bids them, <hi>keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the love of God.</hi> There is nothing comparable to this, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire us with devout and earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:94275:54"/>
And it hath an equal force al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to excite us to Praiſe and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg our great Benefactor, who gives us ſo many good things, even before we deſire them. Do you not ſee how Men delight to commend, extol and magnify that they love? And how laviſhly they are wont ſometime to beſtow thoſe praiſes? There is not any thing in this World ſo excellent, but they will borrow a Metaphor from it, wherewith to adorn their beloved. They go to the precious ſtones and to the ſtars nay to the Sun it ſelf to fetch ſome luſtre from them for their expreſſions. And more than this, it's uſual with love (as every one may obſerve) to go beyond the nature and value of things, and to make thoſe hyperboles not uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which in other caſes are ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. And as for gratitude, we are all ſenſible that nothing is ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging as love: Every favour it eſteems a Treaſure; and ſtudies all means to expreſs its reſentments. So
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:94275:54"/>
that if it become a divine paſſion, you may learn from King <hi>David,</hi> how much it will diſpoſe our hearts to admire and extol the perfections of God, and excite us to give him thanks, <hi>becauſe he is good, and his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy endureth for ever.</hi> Do but read the beginning of the 103. <hi>Pſal.</hi> and obſerve how he calls up all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Soul to aſſiſt in this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Duty of praiſing and bleſſing the Name of God. And then being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to himſelf of his own diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to offer him the praiſes that are due unto his Great and Glorious Name, you may take notice how in other places, he goes to all his Friends, and begs of them that they would joyn in conſort with him, ſaying, Pſal. 33.23. <hi>O love the Lord all ye his Saints;</hi> and 34.3. <hi>O mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Lord with me, and let us exalt his Name together. Let Iſrael now ſay</hi> (Pſal. 118.) <hi>that his Mercy endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for ever. Let the houſe of Aaron now ſay, that his Mercy endureth for
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94275:55"/>
ever. Let them now that fear the Lord ſay, that his Mercy endureth for ever. O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good: for his Mercy endureth for ever.</hi> And leſt all theſe ſhould not be able to make this joyful ſound loud enough, he invites all ſtrangers to come, and help them to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this debt, ſaying, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100. and 117. <hi>O make a joyful noiſe unto the Lord all ye Lands. Serve the Lord with gladneſs; and come before his Preſence with ſinging. O praiſe the Lord all ye Nations: praiſe him all ye People. For his merciful kindneſs is great towards us: and the truth of the Lord endureth for ever. Praiſe the Lord.</hi> Yea, it is frequent with him to extend his entreaties to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that they would lend him their help to acquit himſelf, 103.20. and he calls (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.) upon all the lower Hoſts of God, who are in the Heavens nearer us, and in the Earth alſo, that if they can do any thing, they would bear a part in his Song of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94275:55"/>
Praiſe, which he compoſed in honour of him. And in the very concluſion of his Heavenly Book, that he might ſay all he could, he thus beſpeaks the voice of all things, which either by Nature or Art are framed for delight and pleaſure; <hi>Let every thing that hath breath, praiſe the Lord.</hi> All which Obſervations I thought good to annex to this Diſcourſe of the Power of Love in Prayer, becauſe, when we have ſaid all we can, there is nothing ſo prevalent for a new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as praiſing God, and being heartily thankful for the benefits we have already received. To which the love of God diſpoſing us ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, that it never thinks it can praiſe or acknowledg him enough, it muſt needs obtain much of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace for us; and conſequently ſecure our obedience to him, above all other things. Eſpecially ſince,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Love is ever Watchful:</hi> which is another means, to be joyned with
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94275:56"/>
Prayer, to keep us from entering into temptation. It always hath its light burning, and its loynes girded. It is ready and forward to apprehend and imbrace any occaſion of ſerving him, to whom it is engaged. It is jealous of every thing, which would rob it of that good, which it ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires. And therefore hath its eyes always open, and by reaſon of its heat will not eaſily fall aſleep; nor ſuffer that dulneſs and wearineſs to infeſt it, wherewith others are uſually ſurpriſed. I need not purſue this Argument any further, it being ſo apparent that fervent love and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection chaſes away all drowſineſs of Spirit, and makes a Man ſlip no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to do that which is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the eyes of God. And I am the more willing to quit it, becauſe I have been ſo long in the former, and have two other Conſiderations ſtill to add.</p>
               <p n="4">4. One of them is (which I ſhall
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94275:56"/>
but briefly touch) that it will breed in us <hi>a pious confidence of the ſuccours of Gods holy Spirit,</hi> in the power of which we ſhall be able to undertake any thing that he commands. It is impoſſible to have any heart to do well, if we have not this hope rooted in us; and it is as impoſſible to doubt of it, if we feel the love of God bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in our hearts. Which is both a teſtimony of his Divine Power al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready working in us, and an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he is as willing to do any thing further for us, as we find there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that we are, to do any thing for him. It doth not only widen the heart to impart, but alſo to receive. And the very ſame motion which carries it out towards God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others in ſincere affection; brings home large aſſurances that he will abundantly communicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to it on all occaſions, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging and aſſiſting of its faithful endeavours, to do his will in every thing.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:94275:57"/>5. The other is this (which ſhall put an end to this part of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) that <hi>it hath no leſs power to make us fully aſſured both of the bleſſed rewards, I ſpoke of, in the other World, and of the greatneſs of them;</hi> which are the ſtrongeſt Motives to our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. There is nothing ſo ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the ſight to diſcern, or enlarges the heart to conceive the things of God, as this doth. For God is love, as St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, and therefore he that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him. Among all the goods of this World, we find no where ſuch repoſe and quiet, as in hearty love and true friendſhip. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing give us ſuch a taſte of pleaſure, and, if the Object be worthy, ſuch ſatisfaction. Of two it makes one, ſo that they communicate in each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers happineſs. And this ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is wont to make them forget all other things, at that inſtant: For love is of ſuch a nature, that it endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to take up all the room in the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94275:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
heart, and would leave none for any thing elſe; that it may be intirely and wholly poſſeſſed of that which it loves. And therefore when it is turned towards God, and ſettles it ſelf in him, it muſt needs give us a lively ſenſe of future bliſs, by unite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our hearts, and gathering up our minds (as I may ſpeak) wholly unto it. It participates with that ſupreme good, to which it is united. It car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in it ſelf a great deal of the life of God; it is a part of Heaven, and the buſineſs of the other World. But beſides the ſolace which is inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from it, there is this remarkable property in the paſſion of love; that it ſtrangely diſpoſes us to believe all the kind expreſſions of our friends, and makes us eaſily receive what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſay, for certain truth. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which account the love of God will incline us, above all other things to entertain every thing that he ſhall communicate of his mind unto us. And there is nothing ſo great, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94275:58"/>
ſo magnificent declared in the Goſpel of his Grace, but he that loves God will preſently believe it, and lay it up in his heart, as a ſingular expreſſion of his divine favour. For he feels by the power and force of this affection in his own heart, what God is enclined to do for thoſe, whom he loves and takes delight in; though it ſeem incredible to other Men. And therefore, as it doth not poſe his belief who loves God, when he hears that the <hi>Word was made Fleſh</hi> for the good of men; that <hi>the fulneſs of the God-head dwelt bodily in Jeſus;</hi> that he dyed for ſinners, and lay'd down his life for the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Enemies: So the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt from the dead, his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion to Heaven, the exaltation of our Nature, in his Perſon, at Gods right hand, the Glory and Majeſty in which he is ſaid to ſhine there, and in which we are told we ſhall at laſt appear together with him, are no riddles nor incredible things to him.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94275:58"/>
No; Love ſees him there preparing a place for us, making all ready for the joyful Marriage to be celebrated in his glorious Kingdome, coming in the Clouds of Heaven to call us up thither, and to advance all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to reign, as ſo many Kings, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him. This makes a man preſently underſtand how <hi>God</hi> ſhould deſign to reward our poor endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours (thoſe ſervices to which we ſtand obliged, though but weakly performed) with an everlaſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. How he ſhould compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate our preſent ſufferings which are but for a moment, and not worthy to be named, with a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Eternal weight of Glory. Hyperbole's go down eaſily with this Mans Faith. He can believe beyond them all, and ſee what is far beyond, that far more exceeding E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal weight of Glory, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles words import, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. He is aſſured the love of Heaven will enkindle a new life in our dead aſhes.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94275:59"/>
He beholds it ſublimating this earth, to an Heavenly ſtate. And can well conceive this thick Clay ſhining as the Sun, and made like to the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Body of Chriſt: This Soul alſo, as pure as the light, ſaluting its new born Body, and, poſſeſſed with a mighty love, rejoycing for ever in Gods bounteous kindneſs to it. All this it ſees, nay feels; being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy filled, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>with all the fulneſs of God.</hi> For it feeling, <hi>Firſt,</hi> what a vaſt difference there is between it ſelf now, and what it was before, when it was pent up in ſcant and narrow affection to theſe petty goods here below, makes no doubt there may be as wide a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between what it ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and what it is now. It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently concludes, that the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful goodneſs which rouſed up, and called forth its ſleepy thoughts and drowſie deſires towards it ſelf, can ſtill further awaken and raiſe all its faculties to a more quick and lively
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94275:59"/>
ſenſe: or call forth ſome hidden power and vertue in the Soul, which hath as yet no more appeared, than thoſe motions which now it feeles did, before it was touched by his Almighty hand. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its own nature by this touch of the Divine Love made ſo free and benign, ſo abundant and overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in kind affection to others, ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen-hearted and gracious, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that the Almighty goodneſs not only <hi>can</hi> but <hi>will</hi> do more for it; and confidently expects to be lifted up to an higher ſtate of bliſs, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the ſuperabundant kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that moſt excellent Nature, which hath produced already ſuch good inclinations in it. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a Man to be under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of love, to feel the huge force of its flames, to perceive of what a ſpreading and communicative Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is; and not conceive very magnificently of the bounty of God, and have a faith in him as large and capacious as his love.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:94275:60"/>Love God therefore, <hi>My Friend,</hi> as much as ever you can; with the greateſt paſſion and moſt ardent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: and you ſhall find Heaven coming apace into you, and taſte the good things of the promiſed World to come. You ſhall not only gueſs at your future ſtate, and make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures about it: but in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure know and feel the all-filling joy of our Lord, and poſſeſs that quiet, tranquillity and peace, which paſſeth all underſtanding. For this Divine love is the right ſenſe whereby Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things are apprehended. It is that which fits the mind rightly to underſtand, and the will firmly to believe thoſe great and tranſcendent things, which the Scripture reports, as the portion of the Saints in light. It gives us a ſight of things as much differing from all other, which we have meerly by dry reaſoning, and which we ſpin out by thoughtful Diſcourſes, as the ſight of a great beauty before our Eyes, differs from
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94275:60"/>
the deſcription of it, which we read in a Book: or as the warmth of fire on the hearth, doth from that we ſee in a Picture; which cannot looſen and inliven our ſtark and benummed Joynts. And if you would love God, I have told you the ready way to it; which is by preſerving in your mind a conſtant and lively ſenſe of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite love and good will already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to you: for this will natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and eaſily produce a reciprocal love to him; and that will make you look for more of his mercy, even to Eternal Life. This you underſtand ſo well, that I ſhall not ſay a word to you more about it; but proceed to the next, when I have left a few words with you to ſay to God.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>O</hi> God, how great is thy love! how excellent is thy loving kindneſs towards us thy unworthy Creatures! To whom thou takeſt ſuch pleaſure in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating thy bleſſings, that thou doſt not stay till we ask them of thee, but poureſt them down plentifully before and beyond all our deſires. O the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable depth of that love, from whence thy Son Jeſus was ſent to dwell among us! who hath done ſo much for us, that he hath left us nothing to do, but to conſider and lay to heart thy love, which hath ſo marvelouſly abounded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. For all things, I know, are eaſie and pleaſant to thoſe that love Thee. <hi>Great Peace have they that love thy Law: and nothing ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them.</hi> O poſſeſs this heart, which opens it ſelf to thy gracious influences, with ſuch a mighty love to thee, as may ſet Thee alway before me; and carry forth my Soul in ardent deſires after
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94275:61"/>
thee; and fill me with an humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in thee; and make me watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, active and zealous in my duty; and never ſuffer me to diſtruſt thy pitty and indulgence when I unwillingly offend thee; and aſſure me of thy kind inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in all the croſs accidents of this life, which are moſt offenſive to me.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not, O Lord, of a power from above continually to attend me, now that I feel thy love ſo strong and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful in me. I believe thou wilt do more for me, both here and eternally, than heart can conceive. O how great things haſt thou laid up for thoſe that fear thee! O the heighth of that joy which thou haſt ſet before us, to encourage us in our Chriſtian race! O the comfort of thoſe gracious words, which promiſe us, after our ſhort pains and trouble here, <hi>a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory!</hi> How pleaſant is it to wait for thy Son Jeſus from Heaven, to give a Crown of righteouſneſs to me, and to all thoſe that love his appearing!
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94275:62"/>
Preſerve, I beſeech thee, this holy love and faith moſt freſh and lively in my heart, to my great increaſe in all the fruits of righteouſneſs, which are by Chriſt Jeſus unto thy glory and praiſe. Maintain in me ſuch chearful thoughts of thee, that Religion may be my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, as much as it is my duty; and I may alway approach unto Thee with a joyful heart, being glad to leave the company of all other things, to go to thee, my God, my exceeding joy. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile me ſo perfectly to every other part of my Chriſtian duty, that all the actions of an holy life may be but ſo many motions of hearty love to thee; and I may ſo feel the eaſe and ſatisfaction of all well doing, as to love and delight the more in thee, whoſe wayes are wayes of pleaſantneſs, and all whoſe paths are Peace.</p>
                  <p>I am ſenſible of the uncertainty of all things elſe, but only of thy love, which will inſpire me, I hope, to behave my ſelf worthy of the greatneſs of it,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:94275:62"/>
in every state and condition of life. O that in proſperity I may think I have an opportunity to ſhow, how much I love Thee above the World, by exerciſing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, heavenly-mindedneſs, charity, temperance and purity: and in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, how much I love thee more than my ſelf, by expreſſing all patience, meekneſs, forgiveneſs of others, chearful ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Thee and confidence in Thee, with thankfulneſs for all thy paſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining mercies. Be they always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, and never forgotten by me. For which end I again conſecrate my Soul to be thy holy Temple, wherein may dwell continually pious and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts; devout Meditations of Thee, and remembrance of thy loving kindneſs; intire love to Thee, ſending up perpetual Hymnes of Praiſe and Thankſgiving, together with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſacrifice of an humble and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent heart. That ſo I may be filled with the comfort and joy of the Holy Ghoſt at preſent; and hereafter be admitted

               <p>BUT as I would have you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly in love with Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo I muſt adviſe you, <hi>not to charge your ſelf with too many or too long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Devotion.</hi> For Honey it ſelf will cloy us; and a perpetual ſcent of Roſes may become offenſive to us. Obſerve therefore what you can do with eaſe, and a pleaſantneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: And when you find your ſelf to be free and forward, then you may be the longer and more enlarged in your Devotions. But when you are very heavy and ſtraitned, then it is not fit to tire your ſpirits and drag them along with you, whither they have no ſtrength to accompany you, nor any diſpoſition to comply with your deſires. Our Body is ſuch a beaſt, and ſometimes ſo dull and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtife, that if we ſpur it on to a faſter pace, it not only quite tires; but will have no liſt to travel any more.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94275:64"/>
Whereas if we bait it a while, and ſuffer it to take ſome repaſt, and give it ſome reſt; it will go along with us to the end of our Journey. When our ſpirits are dull already, we make them more dull by our reſtleſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to do as we would have them. As a Child you may have obſerved, when he cannot think of his Leſſon, the more his Teacher chides and calls upon him, the more blockiſhly he ſtands, and the further it is beat out of his memory: ſo it is very frequently with the natural ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of every one of us. They are ſo oppreſſed and ſtupid at certain ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that if we labour to ſet them in motion, it doth but diſpoſe them the more to ſtand ſtock-ſtill. But if we let them alone, and for that time leave them, they will be like the ſame Child, who in a ſhort time comes to himſelf, and is able to ſay his Leſſon perfectly. They will go whither we would have them, and perhaps run before us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:94275:64"/>We muſt do then with our ſelves, as one that is weak, and going up an high and ſteep Hill. When he feels his Legs begin to fail him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that they are weary, he reſts a while and ſits him down to recruit himſelf. And it will not be long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hear his mind calling on him, to try if he hath not gathered ſome new ſtrength, with which he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es a little further, according as it will carry him. And if he hath any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial ſpirits in his Pocket, a little taſte of them may much revive him in this languiſhing condition: Yea, the pleaſant proſpect of the Fields round about him, and the various Objects that gratefully entertain his eyes if he caſt them on every ſide, will be a fit divertiſement for his mind, to turn it from thinking of his wearineſs. Thus I ſay, <hi>My Friend,</hi> it is adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for you to do; reſt your ſelf a while, and make a pauſe, when you perceive your ſpirits begin to flag. Break your Devotions into little
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94275:65"/>
parts, and take not the Journey you have ſet your ſelf, all at once. When your mind tels you, that now you are better able, or prompts you to try your ſtrength, then up again and go forward. And between whiles, turn your mind aſide to ſomething or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is wont to pleaſe you much. Think of ſome good Friend, of the many fair accommodations that God hath afforded you, of the pleaſant Meadows (as I may call them) and the ſtill Waters by which he leads you; or betake your ſelf to ſome Divine promiſe, and take a taſte of the love of God contained therein, which is as a Cordial to chear and refreſh the Spirits; or run to the extract or quinteſſence that you have drawn (as I ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you anon) out of former Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: and ſome of theſe, its poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, may make you quite forget that you were faint and weary.</p>
               <p>And truly, for the moſt part, I
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94275:65"/>
think it is beſt, not to be over long in your Devotions. I have heard of a very good man, who was wont to pray to God, that he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him his long Prayers. Which though they proceeded from an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt zeal, yet wanted their efficacy, by being indiſcreetly tedious. For whilſt Men ſtudy to ſtretch and wire-draw their Meditations to the utmoſt length, what they gain that way, they loſe another; having the leſs of ſtrength and ſolidity, the more they have of length. No Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, you know, is more maſſy and ponderous than Gold; yet it may be beaten ſo thin, that it may be blown away with ones breath, or broken with the leaſt touch of ones Finger. So, many times it is with our Devotions, which have ſome weight and force in them, if they be contracted and gathered into a little room: but while we ſpread them, and beat them out to a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous length, they become ſo thin and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94275:66"/>
weak, that very Object which ſtirs, blowes away our thoughts; and great breaches are made in them, by the leaſt imagination that thruſts in it ſelf upon them.</p>
               <p>This is capable to be abuſed, I am well aware, by Souls that are not truly pious: but thoſe that are, may as much abuſe themſelves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they underſtand and uſe it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when the Soul is very ſtrong and full of heat, or when it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakned by ſome remarkable ſtroke of Divine Providence, or when the mighty hand of the good Spirit of God is upon it, then it may, and will, let it ſelf run without any cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or reſtraints: and we ſhall have nothing to do but to follow thoſe thoughts willingly, which in another caſe we could not perſwade to follow our wills. Our mind then will run (as it were) before us, our hearts will be pregnant and teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with many good Meditations;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:94275:66"/>
which at another time we ſhall not be able to draw after us, nor make to conceive or bring forth one thought that pleaſes us. But now you muſt take great heed, leſt at this or any other ſuch happy time, you think to attain preſently to the perfection you deſire. Alas! <hi>My Friend,</hi> it is a great way thither: and it cannot be ſafe to make too much haſt, though you find your ſelf never ſo willing and forward. For many there are who running full ſpeed, have ſtrain'd themſelves, by fetching too great a leap, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled their Souls for ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And therefore run not your ſelf out of breath, from an eager deſire to be at the very end of your Race. Let <hi>fair and ſoftly</hi> be your ordinary Rule: though ſometimes, in a very ſmooth Rode, and when your Spirits are brisk, you may make as much ſpeed as you can, for a little way. But we have ſeen ſeveral ride upon the Spur, eſpecially in the Morning
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:94275:67"/>
when they firſt ſet out, who have been left behind in the Afternoon, by thoſe whom they ſeemed to have many Miles over-ſtripped. And therefore it is neceſſary counſel (to thoſe chiefly who are beginners) to Travel ſo in the Chriſtian Path, as we hope we may be able to hold out; and not to be ſo fiery at firſt, as to make us dread Zeal, when there may be good uſe of it.</p>
               <p>There is another thing ſo nearly related to this matter, that it would have challenged the next place in this Diſcourſe, did your neceſſities require it. And that is to take heed you do not tire your ſelf with any one thing, for that will make you indiſpoſed to all the reſt. This I take to be good advice to my ſelf, who ought to be cautious, leſt by over-much ſtudy I ſo dull and blunt my Spirits, that even Devotion it ſelf become irkſome to me. And I doubt there are too many of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:94275:67"/>
Gentry and better rank, who ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirit themſelves by ſome of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, that they are fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to lye down and ſleep. But to ſuch as you, I need only ſay, that <hi>You muſt not weary your ſelf with any one pious Exerciſe.</hi> For I can tell by my Imployment, that if I keep one Author company ſo long, that I grow weary of him, I ſhall have no mind to return in haſt to him, and all others will find me more moroſe and indiſpoſed for Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety with them.</p>
               <p>Let me only add, that you will the better do this, if you <hi>labour to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the true reaſon why you do every thing, and mark the fitteſt occaſions wherein it may be done.</hi> The differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the grounds (as we ſpeak) or reaſons of our motions, and the occaſions of them, is this. The former perſwade our will either to decline or to purſue ſomething, that appeares either good or evil; and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94275:68"/>
therefore the ſtronger the Reaſons and Motives are, the more ſhall we be induced either to avoid or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace what is before us. The latter is only the opportunity or ſeaſon, the advantage of time or place, which doth not ſo properly move us to do a thing, as to do it now. Time and Tide, we ſay, ſtayes for no Man; and becauſe the opportunity doth not always happen, therefore it ſtirs up our Soul (which is already enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by ſome reaſon) to work more powerfully at this preſent, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it would have done. So that if you underſtand not only good <hi>Reaſons</hi> for your actions, but mind alſo the <hi>Occaſions;</hi> you will be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily inclined by the one alwayes, and more mightily by the other at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times.</p>
               <p>To grow in Knowledg and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is exceeding neceſſary, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it preſents us with great variety of things to entertain our
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94275:68"/>
mind withall, and makes Religion more pleaſant, and renders our Soul more firm and ſtrong, more ſolid and compact: but likewiſe becauſe while we ſearch into the reaſon of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, we ſhall diſcern whether the thing be only lawful, or it be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient alſo and prudent, and withall neceſſary to be done. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we ſhall know how to make a proportionable allowance of our time and ſtrength, and earneſtneſs unto it. If the buſineſs be meerly lawful you will do it when you have nothing elſe to do. If it be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you will give it a more certain and likewiſe a larger portion of your time and ſtrength; and the very thought of its neceſſity, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force you to it. And it it be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed though not abſolutely neceſſary, yet convenient, and more acceptable to God, if you perform it; then you will do it when you are beſt diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and in the fitteſt temper to do him that more pleaſing ſervice. And
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:94275:69"/>
then, being poſſeſſed with an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love to God and to Religion, upon ſuch ſatisfactory Reaſons as you have propounded to your ſelf, and well conſidered; the obſerving of the Occaſions, which either time or place, or company, or ſuch like circumſtances preſent you, to expreſs it, muſt needs be a mighty awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your Spirit, to beſtir it ſelf with all diligence, in the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch an advantage. And theſe occaſions are therefore of ſuch force to call up our endeavours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know, that as much may be done then, which cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at another time, ſo they will not wait upon us and ſtay our lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and that as they paſs away, ſo we know not when they will come again. For <hi>May</hi> (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is) <hi>comes not every Moneth:</hi> and a fit opportunity lies not, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very lock of Times head. And if there ſhould, yet it is bald behind; and we cannot call back that which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94275:69"/>
is gone, which may be better, than will be preſented to us again. And if we find by experience that theſe occaſions do excite our Souls, then the obſerving and embracing them will be an excellent means to keep us from dulneſs; becauſe it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that God will favour us with more of them, when he ſees that we uſe thoſe well, which he hath given us already.</p>
               <p>But yet you ought to be cautious that this do not prove matter of ſcruple and perplexity to you, if you neglect an occaſion, when you are otherwiſe neceſſarily employed. For both prudence and the forwardneſs of our affections, and every thing elſe, muſt give way to a real neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: and of two neceſſary things, that ſeems to be moſt neceſſary, in which we are already engaged. Make therefore a ſhort Addreſs to God, and both comfort and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en your ſelf, after this manner;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:94275:70"/>
when you are dull and indiſpoſed, or otherwiſe apt to be perplexed, upon ſuch accounts as theſe.</p>

With the former, which are the mind, underſtanding and will, it hath entercourſe with God and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible things, and is fitted to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all lower objects to an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly end: with the other, which we
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:94275:72"/>
call ſenſe, imagination, and ſenſitive appetite, we can maintain acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with nothing, but this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward World. Or rather this one Soul of Man is fitted with Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſuch different kinds, that it can hold correſpondence with God and the higher World, and likewiſe with the goods of the body, in this World which is ſenſible to us.</p>
               <p>Now ſuch a friendſhip there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Soul and the Body, by reaſon of their nearneſs, and between the upper and lower faculties of the Soul (if you ſo conceive of it) by reaſon, as I may call it, of their one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that they do mutual good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for each other, when they are able. And as the Soul lends ſuch a great part of it ſelf, to ſerve the Bodies neceſſities: ſo the bodily ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits likewiſe are ready to aſſiſt the Soul, in their better Moods, to a freer purſuit of its own concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in its motion towards God
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:94275:72"/>
and the things above. And more than this, the pleaſures of the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the other; what the Soul doth for the Body, returning upon the mind it ſelf, and the bodily ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits likewiſe oft-times feeling the contentment, of which the mind ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth. Hence it is that by diſcreet uſe of bodily enjoyments, and due attendance to the outward Mans mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſatisfaction, the ſpirits ofttimes are made ſo mild and ſweet, ſo chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and compliant; that the Mind finds them more ready and forward to accompany it in the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Diviner objects; and it ſerves it ſelf the more, by ſerving the Body for a while. And on the contrary part, when the mind converſes with Heavenly things, they ſo powerfully touch it, at certain Seaſons, that they make a motion there all over, even as far as the very skirts of its Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. The Heart is glad, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits leap and dance for joy, and the very blood in our Veins runs the ſmoother for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:94275:73"/>Now while we have this ſenſible delectation in the borders of our Soul by the agitation of the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, to which the mind communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates its reſentments; there is no part of us, but can be well content to accompany the mind in its devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and they will not be enclined to with draw their attendance from theſe delightful ſervices. But on the other ſide, if the Mind (through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity, it is like, of the Body to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them) cannot impreſs its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions upon the Spirits, nor make ſuch a warmth and heat in them, that they are pleaſed, and move de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully; though it really hath no leſs of God in it ſelf, than it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they skipt for joy; yet now the Body becomes like a lump of Clay, and cannot endure to be drawn any longer to theſe Holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Yea, the Soul it ſelf (unleſs it duly conſider) will begin hereat to be greatly dejected; and to have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle liſt to that, which gives ſo ſmall
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:94275:73"/>
contentment to it, as it is an Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in Fleſh, and which makes its abode nothing pleaſant and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, for the preſent.</p>
               <p>But, if in this ſtate, the Mind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect it ſelf and conſider, that, for its part, it doth what it did before (though it doth not feel it ſelf and perceive its power in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) and that it is not bound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe pleaſurable motions in the lower man, and that they are more pleaſing to us, than unto God; it might preſently have rational ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and tranquillity in its own breaſt (which is the beſt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther joys) and be perſwaded to hold on in its courſe, notwithſtanding this ſeeming diſcouragement. And if the Mind by theſe, or ſuch like conſiderations, be induced to do as it was wont, then I cannot ſee but all its performances would be both more acceptable to God, and in the iſſue more delightful to it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:94275:74"/>For there is more ſtrength of a Mans reaſon and will in them, now that he wants that pleaſing aſſiſtance which the Body uſed to afford him in the doing of them. His love to God is the more fervent and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable, in that it will not ceaſe its motion towards him, though all things elſe fail it, but only the force of its own inclination. He is not, in true underſtanding, more weak and feeble now, but a Perſon of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might and courage than he was before. He breaks through all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and will not ſuffer himſelf to be overborn by the great load, that lies upon his Spirits. I ſaid juſt now that the lower man finding a dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation in Gods ſervice, might be well contented with it, if not deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of thoſe Holy Duties: and ſo the Soul in doing them, gave no great proof, at ſuch a time, of the power and vigour of its own affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to them; becauſe there was no impediment or reluctance, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:94275:74"/>
party. But when there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a ſenſe of its duty to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite it, and all beſide begin to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their conſent; then it is, that it ſhowes its reſolution, and what it can do by it ſelf. Then a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates his heart to be ſo ſet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and to be ſo much in love with him, that he will pleaſe him, though he cannot pleaſe half of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in what he doth, in obedience to his commands.</p>
               <p>And beſides, by a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this that I have ſaid, there may be ſome way perhaps found of recovering theſe ſenſible joyes; which are ſo grateful to us, that we never think we have enough of them. Either (1) by more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring our Mind, and labouring to work in it a deeper apprehenſion of what we go about: And if the fault be there, this will cure it. Or (2) by gratifying our outward man with ſome recreations and ſenſible goods,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:94275:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that it is in love withal; whereby its ſpirits may be better cheared, than they can be, for the preſent, with Divine exerciſes. Seeing it cannot now have a good liking of that which the mind doth moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, let the mind make no ſcruple to comply more freely with it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain it with thoſe innocent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which agree beſt with its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. And if the fault lye there and ariſe from its lumpiſhneſs, this may be a Remedy for it. Or (3) by uſing humiliations of the Body, by abſtinence and faſting (if through too much fulneſs it be indiſpoſed) or by ſmiting on our Breaſt, caſting down our ſelves on our Face (if through too ſtrong a taſte of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyes it be grown untractable:) and if the fault be partly in the mind, and partly in the body, it may be in this manner removed. No bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doubts, but diſcreet Faſting is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable in ſome caſes; and for the other, we find ſo many examples
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:94275:75"/>
of them in the Holy Books, that we cannot think they are to be deſpiſed. Nay, it is likely that good men found by an outwardly humbled body, that the mind was more affected, and apt to be humbled therewith.</p>
               <p>But then remember that it is far better when the Mind affects the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, than when the Body affects the Mind: and we ſhould ſtrive rather after that, though we ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the help of this. I will give you an inſtance, which ſhall, at once, prove this; and ſhow withall the influence the Body hath upon the Mind. Let a Man Pray or Preach in a melting tone, with much acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his hands, and with earneſt looks and motions of his Head; and the affections of the People ſhall be exceedingly ſtirred: when as the very ſame matter and words deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered after another manner, ſhall not half ſo much work upon them. Nay, if the Voice be but ſweet, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:94275:76"/>
the carriage graceful, though there be little action of the Body, and no arts of inſinuation to conjure up the affections; yet the diſcourſe which comes with theſe advantages, ſhall find more favour and better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment with the Hearers; than that which proceeds from an harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er mouth, and a leſs plauſible beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, though otherwiſe it be of far greater weight and moment. And ſo we ſee many People chuſe to ſit in the Miniſters face, rather than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a Pillar or the Pulpit, becauſe they ſay their minds are made more attentive, and their hearts more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged thereby. From all which you are ſatisfied how much the Soul many times is beholden to the eyes, and eares, and thoſe ſtirrings in the blood, which outward Objects cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate. But yet you know very well alſo, that one ſtrong touch or ſtroke that the Mind gives it ſelf by a pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing conſideration, is of far greater force to breed even a ſenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:94275:76"/>
if the Body be diſpoſed; than all the commotions and agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Body are to beget a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſatisfaction and contentment of mind, though it be never ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of it. And the affections, you know likewiſe, that are raiſed by thoſe outward means, are not half ſo much worth, as thoſe which the mind it ſelf excites, from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not the manner of what is delivered.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſenſible conſolations then are not to be ſlighted, but it is far better to look after the other. And if when we deſire them, it were as a ſtep and help to the other, they were the more to be valued and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured after. As the pleaſant trembling and warmbling (I may call it) of the Spirits doth much clarify them, (juſt as the Air is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by being ſhaken) upon that account it is deſirable; for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording our mind a freer ſight of its
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:94275:77"/>
own objects. But if we love it only for the harmony and raviſhing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light that is in it ſelf; then it may prove dangerous, becauſe it is apt to take the mind off from its own proper pleaſures. It is to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that when the Spirits are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by gentle agitations, the Soul ſits in the Body like to the Eye in a clear Sun-ſhine day: But if at ſuch a time it gaze meerly on this light, and do not make uſe of it to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other objects, it loſes by its advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; and for an eye full of light, lets go an heart full of joy and pure contentment. And beſides this, it is to be conſidered that we may be eaſily cheated by theſe ſenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectations; and therefore they are not to be deſired ſo much as the other, wherein there is not ſo much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being cozened. Many warm Souls think themſelves very Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe they are moved at a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or can weep in their Prayers; whereas they remain as cold as a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:94275:77"/>
ſtone, and as dry as a rotten ſtick to all good works. They are cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, peeviſh, proud and cenſorious: and yet theſe ill qualities do not trouble them, as long as they feel thoſe pleaſing motions, which tickle them into a belief that they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God, though they be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And on the other ſide, many good Souls imagine that they have more of God in them at ſuch times, when they find ſuch melting affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their hearts, than they have at others, when they are without them; whereby they ſet a lighter eſteem upon far greater teſtimonies of Gods love (which then they need not want) ſuch as Humility, Patience, Denial of our own wills, and reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his good will and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Upon this account many Papiſts, that have left our communion, are wont wretchedly to deceive and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe themſelves: who profeſs that they find their hearts more ſtirred
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:94275:78"/>
before a Crucifix, and the Image of the bleſſed Virgin, and with Prayers which they hear in an unknown Language, than they were while they attended on the Divine Service of our Church; where they knew, or might have known, as much of God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and all ſpiritual things, as they can do now. Alas! they conſider not how much the fancy is taken with Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and Bodily Geſtures, and all things of Novelty; without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding conſideration of the mind, or any conſent of the will before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Theſe may be but natural motions (ſuch as are common to us with brute Creatures) which are raiſed by outward objects, and not by our ſelves. And as a drop of ſweet phlegme that trickles down upon a Mans Palate in a ſlumber, makes him think he ſwallows ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or is glutted with ſweet meats: So many times do drowſy and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate Souls dream that they are
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94275:78"/>
full of the joys of God, and ſatiated with Divine Pleaſures, when they are but mocked with thoſe natural delights which agreeable Objects ſtroke them withall, while their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are awake, and their minds are aſleep.</p>
               <p>Let us attend therefore, <hi>My Friend,</hi> to the giving all ſatisfaction to our inward man, and ſeriouſly comply with our nobleſt deſires of pleaſing God, by doing his will in every thing. And, if we can likewiſe give contentment thereby, to all about us; well and good: but if that be not poſſible, let us not think we are the worſe becauſe we cannot; ſince we are not the better, if we can. And ſeeing variety is ſo grateful to our weakneſs, you may try what paſſions you can excite in your heart, by this ſhort addreſs to God, which I ſhall add, at the end of this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, to many others which you are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted withall: adviſing you ſtill
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:94275:79"/>
to be ſatisfied and well pleaſed, in the doing of what you ought, though it prove not ſo delightful to you as you deſire.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>O</hi> Great God. What an happineſs is this, that I ſhould be beloved of Thee, who art the Lord of all things! What contentment! what joy! what gladneſs of heart, ought I to conceive in the thoughts of thy ſurpaſſing love to me? and how willingly, how chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, ought I to do thy will, that I may be more beloved of Thee? Thy love is wonderful and unſearchable: we have nothing in us whereby to take a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it. It is beyond our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hath exceeded all our deſires; and what have we larger than theſe? I muſt turn my thoughts therefore into admiration, and stand amazed at thy
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94275:79"/>
marvellous love; who haſt done ſuch things, for ſuch poor, and inconſiderable Creatures as we are. Thou haſt ſent thy Son to be our Servant: and he hath laid down his Life for our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption: and he is alive again and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Heaven to give us hope of thy endleſs love, in life Immortal and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
                  <p>O how ſhort is my underſtanding of all this! O how weak are my thoughts, now that I reflect upon it! And my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, alas! how ſhort do they fall of my thoughts, and how ſoon do they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and expire! I can only cry out, What is man that thou art ſo mindful of him? Lord, what are all the Sons of men, that thou makeſt ſuch account of them? And when I have ſaid this, I have ſaid nothing, but that I know not what to ſay, or what to think of thy love. But it is part of the love, which I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, that thou wilt accept of ſuch as we have: of our little thoughts, and feeble deſires, and weak endeavours,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:94275:80"/>
when they proceed from true love and ſincere affection to thy ſervice. That, O Lord, I moſt heartily profeſs. Truly, I am thy Servant; I am thy Servant: and reſolve for ever to continue in faithful and abſolute obedience to all thy holy and good Commandements. I am willing to be, and to do what thou plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt. And I refuſe nothing (O that I knew how to attain that happineſs!) which may make thy ſervice alwayes pleaſing to me. Support me howſoever, I moſt earneſtly beſeech thee, with thy Almighty Grace, that I may not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned in my duty, by any dulneſs or indiſpoſition that ſeiſes on me: but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in well doing, with an humble truſt and confidence, that I ſhall never forſake Thee, nor be forſaken of Thee. Preſerve me from vain elation of mind, and falſe opinion of thy favour, when I feel my ſelf tranſported with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary delight in thy ſervice; and from all dejection of ſpirit, and unjuſt ſuſpicions of thy anger and diſpleaſure, when I find leſs delight and complacence
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94275:80"/>
in the ſincere and careful performance of all the duty which I owe thee. Fix me in ſuch a stedfaſt and immoveable love to juſtice, mercy, ſoberneſs and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; that ſerving Thee conſtantly in theſe with an equal and quiet mind, I may have an unſhaken belief of thy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable love to me, in all the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and changes which I feel in my ſelf in this life; and an undoubted hope of a better condition in the life to come, through thy inconceiveable mercies in Chriſt Jeſus the righteous.</p>

               <p>BUT that your mind may not grow quite dull, when your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſpirits begin to ſink, and to be flat and liſtleſs, <hi>Obſerve, My Friend, what it was that firſt begat devotion and lively affections in you, towards God and Goodneſs:</hi> for that will be moſt effectual to continue them. It is an ordinary Maxime in Phyſick, that we are nouriſhed out of the ſame things, of which we conſiſt. Liquid things agree beſt with a Child, while its Fleſh is ſoft, and but newly come from ſwimming in its Mothers Womb. Every Lamb runs to the Ewe that yean'd it, and layes hold of her teates; which are near the place where it lately lay. And ſo may we hope to ſuck both moſt ſweetneſs and moſt proper ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, from thoſe truths which firſt affected our hearts, and wherein we have been wont to find the greateſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:94275:81"/>
relliſh. It is obſervable that Iron, which naturally moves towards the Load-ſtone, when it hath once ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and hath been received into its embraces, is more poſſeſſed with a magnetick love, and grows more ſenſible of its attractions, and more deſirous of an union with it, than it was before that touch, which made it feel how it could awaken and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven it. Even juſt ſo it is with our hearts; which when they feel the kind influence and invigorating po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of any thing upon them, are the more diſpoſed to receive the touches and impreſſions of it again, and naturally open themſelves, and wiſh for it with greater paſſion, than they did before they had that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with it.</p>
               <p>If it was the lovelineſs and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then of the Divine Nature and Perfections, which firſt awakened your Heart, think of that, and turn your eyes towards it; for it is not at all withered or decayed. How
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94275:82"/>
doth a fair Image ſometimes ſlip through a Mans eyes into his heart, and ingrave it ſelf ſo deeply there, that it is paſt his power to raſe it out? And will not a ſenſe of God and the light of his countenance, if it ſhine upon us, leave ſuch a laſting remembrance of it in our Souls; that we ſhall like him, and love him longer than a Day? And if the firſt glance of him be ſo ſurpriſing, and make us, that we cannot eaſily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get how amiable he is; O how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more affecting will a ſerious and conſtant contemplation of him prove? If a little ray from his face, that glided into our hearts, we know not how, was ſo ſtriking and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; how ſhall we be inamoured, when we ſtedfaſtly, and on purpoſe fix our minds and affection on Him, deſiring to be better acquainted with his Excellencies? It is impoſſible but you ſhould find your heart more powerfully ſtirred toward Him; when you conſider likewiſe, that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94275:82"/>
you can never diſcover all of him, but new beauties will every Day preſent themſelves, and ſhine upon you, while you feelingly converſe with him. You will not endure your ſelf, if you ſhould love him the leſs, becauſe he admits of your love, and every day appears more lovely and deſirable.</p>
               <p>But it was a ſenſe of his love to you perhaps (which is far more common) that begat in you the affection of love to him. Then there cannot be a more delightful ſubject for your thoughts: nor can Religion commend it ſelf by any thing more than this, that <hi>it is love, begot by love.</hi> And there is nothing ſurer than that you ſhall be conſtant and unwearied in your duty, if Gods mercies and kindneſſes can affect your heart, for they are conſtantly and unweariedly poured forth upon you. The new ones you enjoy daily are ſo many, that you may know by them the old ones are innumerable. You can turn
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94275:83"/>
your eyes no way, but you ſee your ſelf incircled with them, and hear ſomething calling for your love. All his works declare, not only the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of his Nature, but his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs likewiſe and bounty towards you. For every one of them doth you ſome office of love. They all wait upon you at the command of your Heavenly Father; and they would inſtantly deny their Service, did not he continue it by the Word of his Power. He muſt be blind and never ſaw the Sun, who ſees not God and his goodneſs every where: What beauties doth not that great Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary create? What fruits and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers doth it not produce? What Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors doth it not generate? How doth it cheriſh all Creatures? How doth it fill your eyes and eares, and all your Senſes with its Heavenly influences? And how many of thoſe good things, which you behold by its light, hath God beſtowed on you for your portion? Rather than not
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:94275:83"/>
love ſome higher Being, one would be tempted to fall down and worſhip this. The poor <hi>Perſians</hi> of old, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing more glorious, had their hearts wounded with the Raies of the Sun, and the light and warmth of its beames ſeemed ſo admirable, that they adored and loved it as their God. Shall not we then love him moſt heartily, who made that, and all things elſe: who hath opened to us alſo another World (as I have told you) by our Lord Jeſus, far more beautiful and glorious than this, to make us love him? You can never want matter to feed your thoughts, and to recreate your mind with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Meditations, and your heart with Heavenly affections; when his goodneſs is ſo largely diffuſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of all things viſible. Or if, when you would meditate on his innumerable favours, you find that your thoughts ſtand ſtill, and will not ſtir, or that they go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſtart aſide to ſomething
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94275:84"/>
elſe: Your heart will even then burſt forth into admiration and great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of love, to think that his goodneſs ſhould be ſo great to us, who can ſcarce thank him for it, or conſider it.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe it was a ſenſe of ſin, and the evil of it, which moſt ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led your mind, when you began to be Religious; then every thing you ſee, every thing you can think of, will help to aggravate it. And the more you heighten its malignity, and repreſent to your ſelf its formidable nature; or reflect only on its baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſingenuity, together with its pride and arrogance; the more you will unavoidably be rouſed out of the ſin of ſlumber and ſtupidity.</p>
               <p>Or if it was the promiſe of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the belief of immortal life (that I may name no more induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) which firſt invited you to od; that is a thing ſo vaſt, that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:94275:84"/>
your deſires and hopes of enjoying it, will not let you be weary of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. Immortal Life! What a good is that, will you ſay to your ſelf? On what ſhould I fix my eyes ſo much, and with ſo much pleaſure, as on that bleſſedneſs? Who would loſe his Portion in Immortal Life, for all the dying pleaſures and poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this World; though he could be ſure to enjoy them to the end of his days? Immortal Life! I am not yet awake ſure; or elſe the very Name of it would make my Heart leap, and quicken this dull and ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh Spirit, to the moſt earneſt and chearful purſuit of it, in all the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of Chriſtian godlineſs. What ſhould make me move ſo heavily in the ways of God, unleſs it be, that I forget to look continually towards this Immortal Life? And what is that ſhould make me forget it? How come I to loſe that ſenſe, and let go my hopes of Immortal Life? O won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Love! O patient goodneſs!
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:94275:85"/>
which ſtill waits and attends upon me, to remind my Soul of its everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting bliſs. May I after ſo long a time of ſleep, and ſuch forgetfulneſs, be favoured with a ſight of it? Will my love and free obedience be yet accepted? Awake, awake then all the hidden powers of my Soul; riſe up and call him bleſſed. Who can with-hold his heart from devoting it ſelf affectionately to him? With what pleaſures can I entertain my ſelf, comparable to thoſe which grow out of the hope of Immortal Life? Or what ſervice can be unpleaſant, which is undertaken for ſo great an happineſs? The thoughts of it make my Soul light and aërial, even under the burden of this Body. I feel it drawing me up above: from whence when I look down upon all the men of this lower World, how do they appear, but as ſo many little Ants, buſily creeping on a Mole-hill; while I ſit upon the holy Hill of God? O that my mind could dwell there!
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94275:85"/>
Or, ſince I cannot reach ſo high a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, it may never deſcend from thence, but with a lively remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the joys of that Celeſtial Hope; which may bear me up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the petty temptations of this World! For what is it that I labour and toil, with ſuch reſtleſs thoughts and deſires? For what am I troubled and diſcontented? Can any thing make him abſolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, who hopes to live for ever with God? No; I will rejoyce in my Lord always, again I ſay, I will rejoyce. I will bear at leaſt, even all my dulneſs and liſtleſneſs to my duty, with a quiet and compoſed mind, in hope one day to be more full of life.</p>
               <p>Here my Pen is very forward, and would be running on further than my deſign will allow. And therefore I muſt reſtrain it, and abbreviate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the remaining Counſels, having been ſo long in ſome of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:

It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely fit and deſirable, I am ſure, that we, above all the reſt of thy Creatures, ſhould take a perfect contentment and pleaſure in ſerving thee, who haſt not only gratified all our ſenſes with great and delightful variety of good things in this World; but alſo ſent thy Son from Heaven to entertain our Spirits, with joyful hopes, of having our weak and ſhort obedience here, rewarded with great and endleſs pleaſures at thy right hand, in the World to come.</p>
                  <p>Lord, what is man that thou ſhouldeſt have ſuch a regard unto him? And what hearts have we, if after all thy grace we ſhould delight in any thing more than thee; or be weary and faint in our minds, while we are doing thy

But that thou ſhouldeſt deſign, when we expire, to recompenſe the meer diſcharge of our duty here, with the continued happineſs of being with thee, and enjoying thee for ever; is an expreſſion of thy bounty that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all our wonder and admiration. If a full ſenſe of this thy stupendious goodneſs, ſhould now poſſeſs our ſpirits, they would grow, I believe, too big and large for our bodies; and burſting forth in paſſionate love, would make their way into Eternity, which only is wide and long enough, to admire, and love and praiſe thee in.</p>
                  <p>But be pleaſed, O Lord of love, in thy infinite goodneſs, to give me at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſuch a true and lively feeling of it, as may make me think of nothing ſo much, or with ſo much delight and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction

of heart: and as may inflame me with ſuch a fervent love unto thee, that it may melt and diſſolve my will into thine, and conſume all my corrupt deſires, and abate, at leaſt, the chilneſs and indifference of my ſpirit, and offer me up a whole burnt Sacrifice, to thee, my God. And then stay, I moſt humbly beſeech thee, for the fulneſs of my love, and praiſes, and joyful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, till I come to that happy liberty, of having nothing elſe to do, but to love, and thank and magnifie thy Name for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>It is my daily and repeated deſire, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as our Lord hath taught us, <hi>that thy will may be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven;</hi> to which, both now and ever, I ſay moſt heartily, <hi>Amen.</hi> O purge and refine my nature to ſuch a degree of vertue and goodneſs, that I may at leaſt delight to do thy will, as thoſe heavenly Creatures do.

It is a ſhame, that I ſhould groan, or go heavily, under the ſweet, the eaſie and gentle Yoke, of my moſt loving Saviour; none of whoſe Commandments are grievous, but all his wayes, pleaſantneſs; and his pathes, peace. But there is nothing more fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than to think, that I have at any time oppoſed his will, and thrown off the light burden of obedience, which he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on me.

               <p>AND having thus poured forth your Soul to God, you may feel your ſelf ſometimes ſo mightily moved; that your heart runs out, with much pleaſure, in abundance of pious thoughts and holy affections, which you are not wont to find at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times. And then, <hi>My Friend,</hi> let me tell you, it would be of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar uſe, if you would <hi>ſet down thoſe extraordinary thoughts and paſſionate effuſions of your Soul, which you feel in your greater enlargements.</hi> Theſe are as ſo many Records, which you have to ſhow of the Spirits prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and triumph over the dull fleſh. They are the flights of your Soul, whereby you ſee to what it aſpires; and how great and happy it may be, when God pleaſes. They are the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of Gods love, whereby he would indear himſelf to your heart. And you may look upon them, as if they
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:94275:90"/>
were Golden Chains let down from Heaven, to draw and attract you thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and bind you faſt, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, to your duty. It is great pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to throw away ſuch ſweet flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, after once ſmelling of them: to lay by ſuch good thoughts, as we do a common Book after the firſt read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I would wiſh you to find ſome ſafe repoſitory for them, and to lay up carefully ſuch expreſſions of your mind in Meditation or Prayer, as are moſt lively and affecting; and to fetch them out for your uſe, when any dulneſs or ſtraitneſs ſhall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs you.</p>
               <p>As a good Student when he reads a Book, though he may let paſs the moſt of it which he knew before, yet, remarks and preſerves in his Notes the choiceſt parts, in which he finds great ſtrength of reaſon, or ſharpneſs of wit, or may be any ways uſeful to him in his deſign: ſo would I have you mark thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94275:90"/>
in your converſe with God and Divine things, which have in them ſome fulneſs of ſenſe, ſome livelineſs of conceit, ſome elevation of mind, and are ſo much beyond the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrain of thinking; as if they were ſome beam of light darted from an higher hand, or the utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of the Soul to be with God. When you find, I ſay, your concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſo fit and proper, that you ſeem to behold the bare face of truth, when ſome thing ſmites your heart with ſuch a force of reaſon, that you are conſtrained to yield, or when ſuch an holy breath comes into you, that your Soul ſwells and grows too big for your body; let them be noted as carefully as the Moneth and the Day was, by your Parents, which brought you into the World; or as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the happy time, when God beſtowed ſome ſingular bleſſing on you, which made this World a more comfortable place, than otherwiſe you ſhould have found it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:94275:91"/>Examples you know are wont to move us much; and therefore of what power may we ſuppoſe it to be, when we can propound our ſelves for an Example to us? This Copy, as I may call it, of our ſelves, beſides that it will make us bluſh at another time, to ſee how unlike we are to our ſelves, will alſo excite us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſame countenance and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that once we had; and make ſome colour come into our Faces and warmth into our Spirits, when we are pale and cold in the ſervice of God. It will remember us likewiſe of the pleaſurable motions, that were then in our hearts; and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance is the way to call them back again. It will furniſh us alſo with ſome matter for our thoughts, when they are barren, and can bring forth nothing. For, though reading of ſome good Book, in this caſe, may be very advantageous to us, yet nothing can more aſſiſt us than a Book of our own making; the births, as I may
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94275:91"/>
term them, of our own mind: Both becauſe they beſt ſute with our noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and can ſoon find the place where they lay before, and becauſe they will remember us alſo of Gods grace and goodneſs to us; ſo that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhame, or love, or hope will make us ſtrain to do the ſame again, or to excel our ſelves. When no thoughts will ſtir within, we muſt call for ſome helps without to move us; and what is there that will ſo eaſily enter, as that which was once within us before? Nothing ſure can better fit us, than that which our own Souls have cut out and ſhaped for themſelves.</p>
               <p>As a Chymiſt therefore that is drawing out the more retired ſpirits of things, if he grows faint in his work, takes a drop or two of his own extracts, to bring his Soul back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: ſo ſhould we do, when our livelineſs begins to forſake us, and our Soul complains of its weak and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94275:92"/>
fainting Fits. We muſt pour in ſome of thoſe thoughts which we have formerly drawn out of our hearts; which are, as it were, the quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our Souls, and the very ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of our Devotion, that they may recall the life that is flying away. And tell me, I beſeech you, what a reviving it is, but to think that we once had ſuch thoughts in our mind? What a Cordial is it, to the languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul to feed, as I may ſay, upon its own Honey, and taſte of its own ſweetneſs? How greedily will it embrace, and how gladly will it ſmile upon the Children of its own Womb? How pleaſant will it be but to hope, that it may become fruitful again, as well as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? to behold the Picture of what it may be, as well as of what it hath been in former times?</p>
               <p>Save therefore ſome of theſe; and let them not all be ſpilt, as they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill from your Soul. Lay them up
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:94275:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in ſtore; conſidering the time may come when your Soul will be glad to have them reſtored to it, and will receive them as ſo many drops of Balm. Keep them by you, as you do ſome precious Liquor; which by long labour, and many Operations, you have fetcht out of a number of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Herbs or Spices, or other rare Ingredients. For, though you muſt not have recourſe to them every day, yet there may be a ſeaſon, you ſee, when they will do you ſo high a pleaſure, that you may owe your life or your chearfulneſs to them. They may ſtand you, at leaſt, in ſo much ſtead, as to preſerve you from utter diſtaſt of your ſelf, and deſpair of Gods favour; when you are apt to droop, nay ſink under the weight of your Body, or any other load that lies very heavy upon you.</p>
               <p>Chear up your Soul then with ſome of its own ſublimer thoughts; and turning your ſelf to the Father of Mercies, ſay;</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>O</hi> My God; What pledges of thy Love are theſe which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived already from Thee! How pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious are thy thoughts towards me! and how dear and precious have they been in mine eyes! O how great is the ſumme of them! I ſee, I ſee, how gracious thou art. I am not without many tokens of thy readineſs to help me; and of thy kind intentions to promote me, by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient continuance in my duty, to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs. O how ſweet is the remembrance of that time, when thou waſt pleaſed to viſit me, and inſpire my heart with devout affections to thee? How joyful haſt thou made me with the light of thy countenance, which is better than life it ſelf?</p>
                  <p>Accept of ſuch thanks, as I am now able to offer thee, for thy abundant good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me. Bleſſed be thy goodneſs; that I have not lived all my days, as
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:94275:93"/>
a ſtranger to thee! that my Soul hath not always grovelled on the earth, but been lifted up ſometime unto Heaven! Bleſſed be thy goodneſs; that it hath not lay'n continually as a barren Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but been fruitful in ſome good thoughts, and pious affections, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous reſolutions, and worthy deſigns to do thee honour and ſervice in the World. O that this remembrance of thy paſt loving-kindneſs, and of the powerful operations of thy holy Spirit in my heart, may at this time mightily move and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite me to the like devout expreſſions of my love to thee. O that I may feel it renewing my strength; or reviving my Spirit, at leaſt, to a comfortable hope in thee, that thou wilt never utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me. There is all reaſon, I confeſs moſt thankfully, that I ſhould confide in thee: and wait upon thee still, with a ſtedfaſt faith, for freſh influences from Heaven, to make me, howſoever, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere with a conſtant mind, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the diſcouragements I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict

withall, in a careful and exact obſervance of all thy commands.</p>
                  <p>This I know is the beſt proof of my love to thee. And therefore help me, as to pray always ſo, to exerciſe my ſelf in works of mercy, to do juſtly, to be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with humility, to preſerve my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoul in purity, and to diſcharge all the duties of my place and relations with an upright heart &amp; willing mind. And when thou graciouſly vouchſafeſt to enlarge my Spirit, in abundance of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful thoughts of thee, and to raiſe me to the higheſt pitch of love to thee; O that it may not only pleaſe me, but make me better. Lift me up thereby above all the temptations of this World; and quicken me to be the more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all good works, and to excell in vertue: to <hi>increaſe</hi> eſpecially <hi>and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound</hi> ſo much <hi>in love towards my Brethren, and towards all Men, that my Heart may be eſtabliſhed unblameable in Holineſs, before

               <p>AND here I cannot but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you <hi>frequent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and ſerious conſideration</hi> (which you might expect to have heard of before) as of ſingular uſe, for the continuance either of your diligence, or of thoſe delectable affections in it. For the Soul is a thing ſo entire in it ſelf, that if one part be ſtrongly moved, the other will be ſo too: juſt as when the Nave of a Wheel turns round, it makes the outermoſt circumference to circle about with it. Much is ſaid by many on this ſubject; and therefore I ſhall only direct you how to Meditate, when you are dull, and unfit, as you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, for any thoughts.</p>
               <p>When we diſcourſe (you know) with a Servant, and deſire to affect him with what we ſay; if he be ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and heavy, and ſeems not at all
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:94275:95"/>
to be concerned in our words, then we are wont to make uſe of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations, beſeechings, objurgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, exclamations, corrections of our ſelves, admirations, and ſuch like ways, to rouſe his apprehenſion. For we find that if an object touches any of our ſenſes gently and ſoftly, we mind it not while we are intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other matters; but if it ſtrikes us with ſome ſmartneſs, and comes with a vehemency and importunity, it alarmes the whole Soul, and makes it not only hear but demand what's the matter. And thus it is in our diſcourſes, if they barely preſent themſelves before Mens Souls, that are otherwiſe ingaged, they regard them not; unleſs by ſome ſuch form of ſpeech, as I have mentioned, they put on ſome ſharpneſs, and be armed with ſome Authority. If we ſpeak, for example, to one that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a fault, in ſuch terms as theſe; Indeed you are very much to blame; You ought not to have done thus;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:94275:96"/>
it is contrary both to God and to your ſelf; the World will cry ſhame of you; no body will endure you; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſtands perhaps as if he were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and had been compoſed of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible materials. But if we ſay, what did you mean, when you did ſuch or ſuch an action? Whither were your wits and your conſcience gone? Could you do thus, and not tremble at Gods diſpleaſure? Nay, anſwer me, do you think that God is an Idol, who regards you not, and cannot ſtrike? Oh, that any Man ſhould be ſo ſottiſh; that he ſhould be ſuch an ill Friend to himſelf! Ill Friend, did I ſay? ſuch a deſperate Enemy, I meant, ſuch a fury, ſuch a Devil to his own Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This kind of language, it is likely, may make him ſeem a Man; one that is made of fleſh, and not of ſtone.</p>
               <p>In ſuch like manner then may you learn to Meditate alone; by diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with your own Soul after the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94275:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
way of expoſtulation, chiding, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and ſuch like: wherein there is great variety; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great eaſineſs, and no leſs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. It was a more awakening ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, for <hi>David</hi> to ſay, <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul? and why art thou diſquieted within me?</hi> (XLII. Pſal. 5) than if he had only ſaid, I do not do well to be dejected on this faſhion; it is to no purpoſe to afflict and trouble my ſelf; far better and more ſeemly were it for me to reſt contented. And the repetition of this again (V. 11. and XLIII. 5) gives it a greater force, and adds a ſharper edge to it, than if it had been but a ſingle queſtion. And ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe doth it more pierce a ſinners heart to hear God ſay, as you read in the Prophets; <hi>Why will you dye? Wilt thou not be made clean? When ſhall it once be? Shall I not viſit for theſe things? ſaith the Lord: Shall not my Soul be avenged on ſuch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this?</hi> than barely to tell him,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:94275:97"/>
that there is no reaſon a Man ſhould deſtroy himſelf, and that He is very deſirous of his good, and that it is high time alſo a ſinner ſhould amend, and if he will not, that He cannot ſuffer it, but will certainly puniſh ſuch continued contempt of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance. And therefore you need not doubt but your Soul will ſooner open to you, at ſuch knocks as theſe, and more ſpeedily bring forth its conceptions and paſſions by the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifry (as I may call it) of ſuch like queſtions and arguings with your ſelf; than by any other way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you endeavour to help its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery.</p>
               <p>Let me preſent you with an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſuch a diſcourſe, ſutable to the drift and deſign of this Treatiſe. O my Soul (may you or I ſay) are we now to learn that there is a God? Doſt thou know nothing but what thine Eyes ſee, and thy Hands feel, and thy Pallate taſteth? Strange!
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:94275:97"/>
that thou ſhouldſt ſo forget to look into thy ſelf! And muſt I be ever demonſtrating to thee, that thou art not of this earth, but a parcel of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World? What? Doſt thou not call God thy Father? Is it not him thou ſeekeſt? With him wouldſt thou not live for ever? Say, wouldſt thou not? Is not this thy earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire? Speak, and tell me if thou art not of this mind. Need I uſe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words to extort from thee this confeſſion? O how dull art thou, if thou doſt not yet underſtand the difference between his favour, and all the Kingdomes of this Earth! And is it poſſible thy memory ſhould be ſo perfidious, as to have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſenſe of the incomparable happineſs, thou haſt ſometime ſeen, he is preparing for thee? Where haſt thou been? What haſt thou been doing? What is become of all thoſe holy thoughts, and of that bleſſed Hope of immortal life, which was ſo lately the joy of thy heart? Is
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94275:98"/>
that happineſs grown leſs? or is it leſs certain than it was, that thou art grown ſo cold, ſo liſtleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different? Let me hear thee ſpeak what thou thinkeſt of it. Is it true, or is it not? Do we Dream, or is it a certain Report which comes to our Eares, when Jeſus tells us he will give Eternal Life to them that obey him? What anſwer doſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn? Would a man take all the World in exchange, for his Portion in ſuch a bliſs? Shall our preſent ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction here be dearer to us, than our future repoſe and fulneſs of joy in the preſence of the Lord? What did I ſay? Satisfaction? Alas! how far are we all from that? <hi>The eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing, nor the Ear filled with hearing.</hi> Who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched thee then, to think of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy happineſs here? Is there ſo much as room for thy choice, whom thou wilt love, and to whom thou wilt cleave, as thy chiefeſt good? Doth not neceſſity carry thee to God,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:94275:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and to the eternal World, if thou meaneſt to have ſatisfaction? O how glad am I to find that there is thy heart! What a pleaſure is it to love thy God, and to hope thou art belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of him? Doſt thou not hold e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing for thy enemy, which would rob thee of ſuch a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?</p>
               <p>But alas! how long ſhall I find thee full of theſe apprehenſions? Canſt thou aſſure me how many days this ſenſe will abide with thee? O how ſuddenly may I feel thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and become a ſenſleſs thing! How treacherous waſt thou lately; how falſe to thy own reſolutions? Would one think thee a rational being, when thou ſo forgatteſt thy greateſt intereſt? Was it thou who then didſt govern me; or ſome bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſoul that came for a time and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiated in thy ſtead? How often haſt thou told me of a World of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies that watch for our ruine!
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:94275:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and yet how negligent and ſupine art thou, as if we had none? Need I remember thee how long ago it is, ſince thou didſt yield, and ſubmit thy ſelf to the weakeſt of them? Thou knoweſt very well, that on ſuch a day thou wert very angry; but canſt thou tell me for what? On another day (would I could ſay but one day) thou waſt lazy; Were thine Enemies then all aſleep? At another time a ſlight occaſion made thee omit a good duty; O at what a ſmall rate art thou willing to part with thy peace? Can one truſt any more ſuch a ſilly and fickle thing as thou art? Can one rely on any of thy promiſes? How wilt thou be able to hold out in ſuch a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, as we are engaged to maintain? how wilt thou be patient to the end? Such a dull and lazy Soul as thou art, ſo timorous, ſo inconſtant, ſo eaſily abuſed, ſo ſoon puſht down with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very occurrence; what hopes can one have of it? —</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:94275:99"/>By this vehement inveighing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your ſelf, it is poſſible your Heart may be much awakened, even in its moſt liſtleſs moods, to ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous reſolution: and it may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it ſelf after this ſort.</p>
               <p>Sad things are here objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, or if that be too mild a word, why did not I ſay inſufferable things? Much ſloth, idleneſs, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience (I wiſh thou couldſt tell me all) I am accuſed of; and alas! my preſent dulneſs aſſures me it is too true. O that I could deny it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fear of a terrible rebuke! But muſt I therefore be ſo caſt down, as to be diſcouraged? Can he that hath done ill, never be ſo happy as to be able to do well again? May I not hope ſo much, as that I may be chid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den into better behaviour? Where is the doom paſſed that I ſhall never amend? Show me that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, or elſe I will not deſpair of it. True it is I need a great deal of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94275:100"/>
but where ſhould I begin to practiſe it, but upon my ſelf? Is it not fit to attend and wait till I can grow better? Many enemies indeed I have; but ſhall I become an enemy to my ſelf alſo? and ſhall I imagine, that I have no Friend? I have been inconſtant, and peeviſh, and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and a lover of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But muſt I therefore be always ſo? No; Therefore I will not be ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. It is confeſſed, my indeavours have been careleſs and lazy: What ſhould I do therefore, but be more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and induſtrious? I have faln ſometimes; but is it wiſdome there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to lye ſtill? Do you call this good reaſoning? Is there any ſenſe in ſuch a concluſion? Rather I will take more heed to my ſelf, and walk with greater care. What though I have given back in ſome aſſaults? May not a Man recover his courage, and behave himſelf more valiantly? O the folly of humane Nature! that we ſhould undo our ſelves at every
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:94275:100"/>
turn; firſt by doing amiſs, and then by deſpairing to do otherwiſe! Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, that we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of this dangerous miſtake. And let us not deſpond, though we have no reaſon to boaſt, and glory in our reſolution.</p>
               <p>Was not this the condition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Saints, long before I was born? Am I the only example of an heavy and ſluggiſh Soul? Muſt I be recorded the firſt in the Catalogue for inconſtancy? What helps and aſſiſtances then had they, to reſtore themſelves and to preſerve them to the end, which are ſtrangers to our eares? Muſt I diſpatch a meſſage to ſome Forreign Country for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe's, as we ſend for Drugs and Spices?

Look then on thy bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, look on his holy Apoſtles, nay, look upon all thoſe excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Church that have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded them; Shall we not follow ſuch glorious Leaders?

How can we be lazy and unwilling to do, when we ſee how forward, how ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently deſirous they were to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer?

                  <p>
                     <hi>O</hi> Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy Name in all the Earth? who haſt ſet thy glory above the Heavens. When I conſider thy Heavens, the work of thy Fingers, the Moon and the Stars which thou haſt ordained; What is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable man that thou art mindful of him, and the Son of man that thou vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiteſt
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:94275:103"/>
him? For thou haſt made him a little lower than the Angels, and haſt crowned him with Glory and Honour. Lord! what honour is that which thou haſt conferred on him? in ſetting him now in the Perſon of Jeſus, above the Angels themſelves? For to which of the Angels didſt thou ſay at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thee? And, again; Let all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God worſhip him? Who in the Heaven can be compared unto the Lord? Who among the mighty can be likened unto the Lord? And therefore whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee. O God, thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee. My Soul thirſteth for Thee, and longeth after Thee. O when wilt thou come unto me? There be many that ſay, Who will ſhew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon me. Show me thy ſelf, and it ſufficeth. Lord, what wait I for? Truly, my hope is in Thee. My Soul, wait thou only upon God, for my
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:94275:104"/>
expectation is from him. By thee, O Lord, have I been holden up from the Womb; thou art he that took me out of my Mothers bowels. My Praiſe ſhall be continually of Thee.</p>
                  <p>But who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? Who can ſhew forth all his praiſe? Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou haſt done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto Thee: if I would declare and ſpeak of them, they are more than can be numbred. O how great is thy goodneſs, which thou haſt laid up for them that fear Thee; which thou haſt wrought for them that truſt in Thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sons of men? What ſhall I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto the Lord, for all his benefits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me? I will delight my ſelf in thy Commandments which I have loved. My Hands alſo will I lift up to thy Commandments which I have loved: and I will meditate in thy Statutes.</p>

                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:94275:104"/>O how I love thy Law! it ſhall be my Meditation every day.

With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, it will be always night with you, or but a cold Winters day; and as you will have no liſt either for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation or any other employment, ſo you will be apt to live in perpetual ſuſpicion of God, and of your Friends, and of your ſelf.</p>
               <p>Melancholy is a dull lumpiſh hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which makes us of a frozen diſpoſition, and a Leaden temper. It inclines us not only to think worſe of our ſelves than we are, but to do worſe than otherwiſe we ſhould. It repreſents thoſe things as exceeding
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:94275:105"/>
difficult, which may be done with eaſe; and thoſe as impoſſible, which have in them any conſiderable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. It benums and ſtupifies our Souls; and will let us feel nothing but it ſelf. It quite diſpirits us, and will not ſuffer us to do any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it imagines we cannot ſtir. It ſhows us to our ſelves in an ugly Glaſs; and then no wonder we look amiſs upon all things elſe. Some things it makes to appear bigger than they are; and then all the reſt appear leſs. And having conceived them otherways than they are, it nouriſhes the conceit till we believe it real.</p>
               <p>As under the weight of ſome ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh matter in the blood, a man ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fancies his Arms are as big as Poſts, and then his Hands ſeem as heavy as a Pig of Lead, and he thinks he is unable to lift them up to his Head: ſo it is with our minds, when they are oppreſſed with the burden
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:94275:106"/>
of a ſad and melancholy humour. It makes all our duty ſeem very great, and our ſtrength to be none at all. All impediments it renders as big as Mountains; but our ſelves not of force enough to remove a ſtraw. It firſt binds up all the powers of the Soul, and then will not let them be unlooſed. It makes us very fearful of that, which it perſwades us we cannot avoid. And it afflicts us for that, which yet it makes us fancy we cannot do. In an heat it puſhes us forward; but ſuddenly it cools, and ſays we cannot go. If it catch fire it makes us wild; and when it hath ſpent that flame, it leaves us ſots and fools. It pricks us forward ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to an enterprize; but it ſelf is the ſhackles and fetters that will not let us move.</p>
               <p>This heavineſs you muſt take heed of, and give no indulgence to it: For it is the <hi>worm of the mind</hi> (as one of the Antients expreſſes it) which eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:94275:106"/>
up its Parent that brought it forth. Contrary to the nature of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther births, it pleaſes us much, when we bring it forth, but proves a miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able torment to us, as ſoon as it is born. Melancholy muſings, I mean, are at firſt a very delightful enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to the mind; but they grow in a little time to be a very troubleſome brood. They are a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous maze, in which a Man may eaſily loſe himſelf, and from whence he cannot, without much difficulty, get forth. Honey is not ſweet to a feaveriſh man; nor are the ſweeteſt truths acceptable to the ſad. Clogs are not a greater impediment to the Feet, than this humour to the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Soul. The eyes are not more darkned with ſome kind of fumes and vapours, than the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is with its black imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Ayr is not more poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when it is charged with a thick and ſtinking miſt, than the mind is offenſive to it ſelf and others, when
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:94275:107"/>
it is buried in its Clouds. And as the Sun, when it looks through a Fog, ſeems as if it were all bloody: So do the faireſt objects, even God himſelf, appear in a diſmal and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ſhape, when theſe ſullen exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions gather about us.</p>
               <p>Labour then continually to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe them, and blow them away by ſuch means as you find, by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to be moſt available to that purpoſe. For chearfulneſs cauſes the Soul to breath in a pure Air; and to dwell in a wholſome and ſweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure. It makes our work ſeem eaſie, and difficulties ſeem little, and God ſeem good, and ſo our ſtrength ſeem great and irreſiſtable. It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens the mind, it incourages the heart, it adds wings to the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and therefore he that forbids it to our Souls, keeps out the welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Gueſt, and the beſt Friend that Nature hath. It misbeſeems none but the wicked, in whom it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:94275:107"/>
a light mirth and a fooliſh jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. As you ſee fine ornaments and curious dreſſes ſet off an handſome Face, though they render thoſe who are ugly more ill-favoured: So doth chearfulneſs exceedingly become good Souls, though in bad men it be moſt ridiculous.</p>
               <p>For which cauſe, it is neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet to uſe any helps that Nature affords us to acquire it; nor to call in the aſſiſtance of innocent arts and pretty inventions to invite it to keep us company. <hi>Socrates</hi> bluſhed not to be found at Boyes-play with his Children. The wiſe and ſolemn <hi>Cato</hi> ſometimes ſtooped to be a little frol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. The great <hi>Scipio</hi> thought it not unbecoming his triumphal body (as <hi>Seneca</hi> calls it) to uſe grave dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and trip about a Room in decent meaſures. Some devout men indeed have pronounced of ſuch like paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as Phyſicians do of Muſhromes, that the beſt ordered are worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:94275:108"/>
but they did not mean ſure to decry all thoſe pleaſures which of themſelves are indifferent, and which the intention alone can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der good, as well as evil. You ought not to refuſe any ingenious or harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs recreations, which you find will cheriſh or refreſh your ſpirit; though by Souls of a dark complexion they be deemed fooleries. It is too great a burden to impoſe on your ſelf ſuch reſtraints, as not to dare ſo much as laugh; for fear of giving occaſion of ſuſpicion to the weak, or of ſlander to the wicked. But ſince a ſpirit free and full of life is moſt uſeful, being indued with more ſtrength and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity than any other, it ought to be preſerved in its alacrity; and when it droops and languiſhes be excited to recover its chearfulneſs again.</p>
               <p>I know you do not think it a crime to laugh; nor are you in love with a ſtudied face. You are none of thoſe who take innocence and ſeverity to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:94275:108"/>
be ſuch inſeparable companions, that they can never be found aſunder: nor that judg a free carriage to be a certain ſign of an ill mind; and a merry humour to be a conſtant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of levity of ſpirit, or want of judgment. But I deſire that you would not only think it lawful, but neceſſary, to be pleaſant; and that you would by no means ſuffer your ſelf to become ſad, under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of being ſerious. The Ancient Chriſtians were ſo cautious in this Point, that we read in <hi>Palladius</hi> of an old Hermite, who, having five hundred Scholars, would never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs them without this Leſſon, <hi>My Friends be chearful;</hi> do not forget, I beſeech you, to be chearful. This was his conſtant lecture; which he repeated as often as St. <hi>John</hi> did thoſe words (which he is reported always to have had in his mouth) <hi>My little Children, love one another.</hi> He took it, I ſuppoſe, out of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who gives this admonition thrice to the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:94275:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Philippians,</hi> III. 1. IV. 4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord. Rejoyce in the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; and again I ſay rejoyce.</hi> It is an unſeemly thing for you to be ſad and heavy, who ſerve ſo good a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, from whom you ſhall receive the reward of an Eternal Inheritance. If they that traffick in earthly Goods rejoyce in an advantageous bargain; Why ſhould not Religious People, whoſe Merchandiſe is Wiſdome (a choiſer thing than Silver or Gold) who have many divine bleſſings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in poſſeſſion, and are in certain hope of more and greater; cheriſh a perpetual joy, and ever be of good comfort?</p>
               <p>By which you may ſee, whence we are to derive our chearfulneſs, and to what we muſt be principally beholden for it. It ſprings out of an hearty and ſolid belief of the bleſſed Goſpel, and out of a ſincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it; and increaſes with our growth in ſpiritual knowledg and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:94275:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
underſtanding, and in love to God, and all our Brethren. All which, it would be eaſie to ſhow you, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in thoſe words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> 11.2, 3. where he expreſſes his earneſt deſire for them, and other Chriſtian People, <hi>that their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full aſſurance of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to the acknowledgment of the myſtery of God, and of the Father, and of Chriſt; in whom are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when our natural ſpirits fail and ſink within us, we muſt uſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural remedies to recruit them and raiſe them up again. None are to be rejected which are not ſinful; or will endanger to make us ſo. But thoſe eſpecially are to be choſen, which will chear the Body, and yet do no injury, but rather prove bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, to the Mind. Of which ſort I ſhall recommend one to you, when

I have concluded this Advice, as I have done the reſt, with a ſhort Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God.</p>

                  <head>A PRAYER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O</hi> Father of Mercies, and God of all comfort: who haſt given us everlaſting conſolation; and good hope through thy grace in Chriſt Jeſus. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be thy abundant love, which hath exceeded towards us in him, beyond all our deſires. O how excellent is thy love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindneſs, O God, which hath ſo bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in Chriſt Jeſus, that it is become our duty to rejoyce in him alway, and to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad, even in the midſt of all the troubles of this life! O that I could keep ſuch a perpetual and freſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his benefits in my mind, as may make me rejoyce evermore! That ſo I may recommend the Religion
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:94275:110"/>
of our Lord Jeſus to all others; and teſtify to all the World, by my alacrity in doing and ſuffering his bleſſed will, that his Yoke is eaſie, and his burden is light.</p>
                  <p>Poſſeſs me with ſuch right notions and apprehenſions of thee, and bleſs me alſo with ſuch integrity of heart; that I may both have the peace of a good conſcience, which is a continual feaſt, and be filled likewiſe with joy in the Holy-Ghoſt, out of a ſenſe of thy divine favour to me, which is better than life it ſelf. Deliver me both from unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſadneſs, and from vain mirth. Preſerve me conſtantly in an equal tranquillity of mind, and a becoming chearfulneſs of ſpirit. Bear me up, I beſeech thee, above all the afflictions which may befall me, by the joyes of faith, and hope, and love. And when I ſhall need the relief of inferiour plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; O that they may never make me loſe the taſt of Heavenly delights; but rather diſpoſe me, by the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:94275:111"/>
of my body, to a more lively diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of all my duty, and to a quicker ſenſe of all divine enjoyments. And teach me to be ſo wiſe in the choice of my pleaſures, that they may not leave me ſad afterward: but I may remain innocent and unblameable before thee, and be better pleaſed alſo in the humble expectation of the <hi>times of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſhall come from the Preſence of our Lord.</hi>

               <p>THIS puts me in mind to ſpeak a little of <hi>Good Company,</hi> as a ſingular means not only to chear and refreſh your ſpirits; but to quicken and improve your mind alſo, in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or vertue. <hi>The joy of one Soul, is no joy,</hi> ſay the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in their common Proverb; which is much-what the ſame with that of the Greeks, <hi>One man, is no man.</hi> Good Company will help to divert our thoughts, and yet not let us ſpend our time unprofitably. It will make us chearful, and yet wiſe and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: It will delight us, and do us no harm; but make us rather much better.</p>
               <p>Some chearfulneſs, I confeſs, is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in a Mans ſpirit, to make him good Company for his Neighbours; for it renders his conceits quick and pleaſant, his words gracious and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:94275:112"/>
and his very countenance ſmooth and obliging. But if ſome dulneſs at preſent make him not to be a good Companion for them, yet they may be the better company for him; and their chearfulneſs may ſerve to revive his ſpirits, and make him as brisk and well pleaſed as themſelves. For it is not more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to us to yawn, when others do; than to be uncloudy in our countenances, when the Faces of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhine.</p>
               <p>We can ſcarce refrain from ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when we are entering upon a very long Journey, through ways in which there are many dangers, and which we have never gone before. But to perform it all alone is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable, that we are apt to grow weary as ſoon as we have begun it: and therefore are mighty inclined to ſeek for ſome Fellow-travellers, to make it ſeem leſs tedious. Our very Horſes will go the better, when they
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:94275:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
travel together: And the Beaſt (as ſome Philoſophers call our Body) which we carry along with us, will not be ſo ſoon tired, if we let it have ſome to follow, and bear it company. Whether it be that the forwardneſs of others ſpurs us up to mend our pace, or whether it be that love to them makes us like them, I know not; but ſo it is, that they who have the goodneſs of others to help and incourage them, are wont to find themſelves better diſpoſed, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they ſhould have been, if they had lived alone.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Obſervation, XIII. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. that, <hi>He who walketh with wiſe men ſhall be wiſe; but a Company of Fools ſhall be the worſe for it.</hi> We have an example of the former part of it (ſaith <hi>R. Eliezer</hi>) in <hi>Lot;</hi> who by the pious Example of <hi>Abraham</hi> with whom he lived, became a good Man, imitating his works, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his ſteps. For as <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:94275:113"/>
when he dwelt in <hi>Charran,</hi> was wont to exerciſe hoſpitality, and to receive ſtrangers: So did <hi>Lot</hi> when he dwelt in <hi>Sodom;</hi> whereby he had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to entertain Angels. As a Man (ſaith he) who goes into the Shop of one that ſells Spices, though he cheapen and buy nothing, yet receives a grateful odor, and carries away a refreſhment: So does he that converſes with the juſt, partake of their good manners, and carries away a ſweet remembrance of their works. Therefore, <hi>either ſociety, or death,</hi> is a common Proverbial wiſh among the ſame <hi>Hebrews.</hi> One cannot tell which is the greater deſert, as <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiclides</hi> was wont to ſpeak, (as <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> tells us) a place <hi>where there is no ſpring, or where there are no good Neighbours.</hi> He muſt be more than a Man, whoſe ſpirits do not fail him, if he want this refreſhment. He will ſoon be gone to another World, if he have no ſociety in this. It is a thing ſo neceſſary, that company not
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:94275:113"/>
ſo good as we would wiſh, proves, now and then, better than none at all; if it be but to make us more contented when we are alone, and the more to prize our ſolitary oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities.</p>
               <p>And if we cannot have the ſociety of many, yet we may find great uſe of one ſpecial Friend, if well choſen. Nay, it is the advice of the wiſe Son of <hi>Syrach,</hi> VI. <hi>Eccluſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Be in peace with many: nevertheleſs have but one counſellour of a thouſand.</hi> O how great a good is this, for a Man to meet with a well-prepared Heart; wherein to lay up his ſecrets, more ſafe than a Jewel in his Cabinet? whoſe conſcience and fidelity he ſhall ſtand in leſs fear of, than his own, whoſe diſcourſe ſhall lenifie his care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; whoſe Opinion ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch his Counſels; whoſe chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs ſhall diſſipate his ſorrow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>; and whoſe very aſpect is delightful! This is a Jewel worth ones ſeeking;
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:94275:114"/>
and he that hath him not is but half a Man. <hi>A man without a Friend is like the left hand without the right,</hi> as one of the Jewiſh Doctors ſpeaks. He is an imperfect Creature; and, according to this Man's Opinion, wants the better part of Himſelf. But howſoever we may take <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s word for it, that <hi>two are better than one.</hi> If we have the uſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Mans parts, time and labours; it is as if we had two Souls, and as many Bodies; and did ſee with four Eyes, and think with two under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings. He illuſtrates this in that place, IV. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9, 10, &amp;c. by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting three Caſes, (which may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily applied to our ſpiritual concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) wherein the benefit of a vertuous friendſhip plainly appears. <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the caſe of inward weakneſs he ſaith, <hi>if the one fall, the other will lift up his fellow.</hi> When we ſlip, a good Friend will ſupport us; or if we be down, he will preſently reſtore us to our ſelves again. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:94275:114"/>
caſe of dulneſs, <hi>if the one be cold, the other may communicate ſome heat to him.</hi> If any Perſon think himſelf ſo ſtrong, that he is not in danger to fall, yet the beſt grown man may feel ſome chilneſs, &amp; ſpiritual numb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs creep upon his Soul: for, alas! we are at a great diſtance from the Sun, in compare with thoſe who are above, and it is, as it were, a Winter with us, while we are here in this lower World. Now, <hi>how can one,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be warm alone?</hi> But, <hi>if two lie together, then they have heat.</hi> As two Fire-ſticks will ſingly caſt no warmth, but let their Flame dye; whereas both together will make a good Fire in the Chimney: ſo will two Friends that lie cloſe to each others hearts, keep themſelves from that coldneſs, which ſeparated would ſeiſe upon them both. And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the caſe of worldly troubles and violent enemies that outwardly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault them, though they may prevail againſt one, yet <hi>two,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>ſhall
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:94275:115"/>
withſtand them.</hi> When we have a ſecond, we may venture to go into the Field: and by a double ſtrength we may take up the Bucklers, and hope to overcome, when we might juſtly doubt of our own ſingle va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
               <p>But I cannot better repreſent the truth of all this, than in the words of <hi>Simplicius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Epict. Cap. <hi>37.</hi>
                  </note> an excellent Philoſopher; who hath brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but fully demonſtrated the many happy advantages of pure and hearty Friendſhip, in a diſcourſe to this effect.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>There is a truth in what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid, that when a Man hath got a Friend, he hath no longer one, but two Souls and Bodies. And then who can doubt, but that they who are poſſeſſed of each others Perſons, will have a communion in their external goods? But what is this, in compare with that great
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:94275:115"/>
light of truth, which ſhines in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Souls? and with that compleat vertue, which, ariſing out of what excels in each, and being brought, as it were, into one common ſtock, is countenanced by the Heavenly Powers, who ſhine upon it, becauſe of its perfection? They are ſafer than other Men in their Counſels; they are leſs apt to trip in their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; which are corroborated both by Prudence, and by Power. Nay, ſuppoſe a Mans occaſions call him into a far Country; he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, by his faithful Friend, to all the relations he leaves behind him at home. Nay, not only while he lives, but when he is dead and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to another World; he is as ſecure of their happineſs, during the life of his Friend, as if he ſtill remained himſelf and converſed among them. And what is there more pleaſant than the ſight of a Friend? What more grateful, than to hear his voice, and to behold his
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:94275:116"/>
worthy actions? And as for truſt and confidence, neither Kindred, nor alliance to great Perſons, nor Riches, nor any thing elſe can ſo much aſſure it, as generous friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And therefore <hi>Alexander</hi> was not ill adviſed, who pointed to his Friends, when ſome asked where was his Treaſures? There is no ſuch Inſtructor and Tutor, as a Friend. None can perſwade us with ſo much eaſe; nor can any Man reprove us with ſo little of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; nor do we fear to offend, and do amiſs, upon the account of any ones diſpleaſure, ſo much as his. When he is preſent, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves our pleaſures, and augments our proſperity: And as for our cares, he very much lightens them, and eaſes us of their burden. And what is there that can teach us ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, and an obliging converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo much as he? Obſerve how willing, or rather glad we are, to yield him the precedence in all
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:94275:116"/>
things. We readily paſs by his faults, and overlook his errors. We declare our mind to him ſimply, and without any diſguiſe. We are ſtudious how to requite his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; and preſerve, at leaſt, a grateful remembrance of his good turns. And as for humanity, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and good nature, there is none to whom we extend it with ſo much alacrity, as to a Friend. For whom we are not unwilling to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelves to any danger: in ſo much, that if there were an Army of Friends liſted, a few Perſons would conquer great Multitudes. And therefore if a Man exerciſe himſelf in theſe things diligently, towards ſuch a Perſon, and make them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and eaſie to him by means of this friendly ſympathy; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt he will be diſpoſed, when occaſion requires, to do the ſame proportionably, and as far as is meet, unto all other Men. Behold, the benefit of Friendſhip: whoſe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:94275:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſweet influences all the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood feels, and fares the better for it. For it is not unworthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that it is Friendſhip which is the beſt bond, and ties us faſteſt to natural Relations. Nothing but this can link us to them with a ſtrong affection, and make us truly forward in their ſervice. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Brethren and Siſters, or Parents and Children, or Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife, if they be not Friends alſo, though they be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to good Precepts, and perform the duties of their natural Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they will not diſcharge them with a chearful will, and with gladneſs of heart. They may be conſtrained to ſerve each other, leſt they ſhould ſeem to neglect their duty: but it is not nearneſs of blood, nor any thing elſe, that will make them freely apply themſelves to it, as a good that they love, and on which they have ſet their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. They muſt be beholden for
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:94275:117"/>
this, to friendly affection, which alone can make theſe relations hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Whoſe power is therefore ſo predominant, becauſe it is the daughter of the will, the fruit of a voluntary choice. This makes it excell all natural affections, as much as the rational and voluntary operations, tranſcend all the other motions in humane Nature.</p>
                  <p>But what's all this, though great and wonderful, to that which may be ſtill ſaid in its praiſe? We have ſpoken hitherto, but of an humane good: That which is the greateſt of all, and the moſt Divine thing in it, is not taken notice of; <hi>viz.</hi> the approaches it makes to the other World. <hi>For ſincere friendſhip con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the Souls of two into one, is the moſt excellent indeavour of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, after union and conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with God.</hi> The union of Souls, who are near of kin here, is the preparation for the Heavenly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:94275:118"/>
and it is impoſſible without this, to be a conſort of the better Beings. The ſenſe of which made the <hi>Pythagoraeans</hi> prefer friendſhip before all other good qualities, and to call it the bond and combination of all the vertues. For no Man that is unjuſt, or intemperate, or fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or ignorant and fooliſh can be capable of it. But he that would be a Friend, muſt purge himſelf from all the brutal affections of the Soul; and then ſeek for his like. And when he hath found him, let him embrace that Perſon, as if he had met, according to the fable of <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> with the other half of himſelf.</p>
               </q>
               <p>But the difficulty, you will ſay, is in finding him. True; and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſome judgement to make a right choice. We muſt deliberate of all things with our Friend, but firſt of our Friend himſelf. And therefore you muſt remember the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:94275:118"/>
advice of the Son of <hi>Syrach,</hi> VI. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus. 7. <hi>If thou wouldeſt get a Friend, prove him firſt; and be not haſty to credit him.</hi> For though Friendſhip begin in converſation, where Men ſoon find a mutual liking of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Perſons, Words and Actions; yet they cannot ſo ſoon diſcover that likeneſs of humour and diſpoſition, and that ſympathy in deſires, which hath the greateſt power to unite Souls. In ſo much that when by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of converſation and mutual liking and happy agreement in all things, they are made one; the ſtate of things is ſo altered, that as at the firſt the Perſon was liked for what he ſaid or did, now the ſpeeches and actions ſhall be liked, becauſe they are ſaid and done by that Perſon.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall ſcarce ſay any thing new in this Argument, (of which you know where to find a larger diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) and therefore I ſhall only add this, which is ſutable to the buſineſs
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:94275:119"/>
in hand. When you want ſuch an one, let him not be a Perſon that is ſad and melancholy, or that loves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be complaining; for, though he be never ſo honeſt and faithful, he will prove but an heavy Companion. And on the contrary, one that is too merry and jocund, will be no leſs diſagreeing to a ſerious ſpirit; and be apt to offend more by his levity and imprudence, than he gives con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent by his liberty and mirth. The happy mixture of both theſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which will ſerve for a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to each other, compounds that Perſon, after whom we enquire. Juſt as the <hi>Romans</hi> (it is obſerved by an ingenious Perſon) eſteemed beſt thoſe Tribunes, who teſtified moſt inclination to the Senate; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Senators thought thoſe the beſt, who favoured moſt the Peoples ſide: So it ſeems that the beſt of the pleaſant humours are thoſe that come neareſt to the melancholy; and the beſt of the melancholy, thoſe that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:94275:119"/>
neareſt to the pleaſant. For where there is this temperature, the firſt ſort will be more diſcreet and prudent; and the latter leſs auſtere and incompliant. And if ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have a quick ſenſe of Divine matters; and be of a pittiful and ſympathizing diſpoſition, free from envy, patient of labours, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in his pleaſures; if he have done us good before he was asked, and when he had done it, keeps it as a ſecret, and ſpeaks not of it (which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerves, is a ſign he doth it for our ſake,<note place="margin">L. <hi>2.</hi> Rhetor. cap. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> and for no other end) you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the greater confidence in him, as one that is both more able and more willing to do you ſervice.</p>
               <p>And therefore when you have found ſuch an one, think you have found great riches, though you ſhould be never ſo poor. Great Riches, did I ſay? Rather the greateſt Treaſure in this World. For if a Man be more
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:94275:120"/>
worth than all the World, (as our Saviour ſuppoſes, IX. Luk. 25.) then he is the moſt wealthy Perſon, who intirely poſſeſſes a worthy Man, that's like himſelf: And there is no way to acquire ſuch a poſſeſſion, but only this. For though a <hi>Slave</hi> or a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> be ours, yet they are ſo but in part. The firſt gives us power over him out of fear, and the ſecond, for reward: But it is a power over their Bodies only, and not over the men. Becauſe neither fear of puniſhment will tye up a Slave from rebellious thoughts; nor hope of reward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige a Servant, to a chearful obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in his will. He only hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely gain'd a man, and ſo added to himſelf ſomething better, than any poſſeſſion in this World, who enjoys a <hi>Friend,</hi> and hath won an abſolute power over the heart and affection of another Perſon. This is a rich man indeed, eſpecially when the Perſon he enjoys is one of real worth; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a mind ſtored with the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

of Divine wiſdom, and an heart full of the love of God. Otherways it muſt be confeſſed, a Man loſes by this gain, and hath the leſs by this acceſſion of ſeeming riches. It was an audacious fancy of <hi>Boccalin</hi>'s, and an unjuſt eſtimate which he made, when (in his Ballance wherein he weighs all the States of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) he ſuppoſes <hi>England,</hi> which he throws into the Scales for a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpois to <hi>France,</hi> to weigh the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upon the addition of <hi>Scotland</hi> to it. But if we conceive the like Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance for our purpoſe, we ſhall find it too true, that he who contracts a Friendſhip with a prating Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or a Perſon of no inward worth and value, will feel himſelf the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and the weaker (when he comes to weigh what he hath got) for his pretended increaſe; and the annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Friend, will be an heavineſs, and not a refreſhment to his mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whoſo feareth the Lord,</hi> therefore,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:94275:121"/>
                  <hi>ſhall direct his friendſhip aright:</hi> (as the Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> ſpeaks, VI. Ecclus. 17.) <hi>for as he is, ſo ſhall his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour (or Familiar) be alſo.</hi> God loves ever, as the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> ſaying was, to bring like to like. He will guide a good man in his choice, and lead him by the hand to one that is good. In whom he will make account he hath found ſuch a plentiful fortune, that he will not be content to forgo it, and take his portion in ſome other goods. For, you may truſt the ſame wiſe man, <hi>Nothing doth countervail a faithful Friend, and his excellency is unvaluable,</hi> v. 15. It is a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to us, but to think that we have ſuch a treaſure: for we receive no ſmall benefit by him, even when he is only the companion of our thoughts, and is not otherwiſe preſent with us. And therefore, <hi>change not a Friend for any good by no means: neither a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Brother for the Gold of Ophir,</hi> VII. 18. Covet his company above all others; and do not think you can
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:94275:121"/>
preſs too near him, or be too familiar with him. Love him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly; and be not willing, on any occaſion to be divided from him. There can be no danger you ſhould claſh, by being ever together: For as one of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> excellently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, <hi>A Needles eye is not too strait for two Friends; and all the World is not wide enough for two Enemies.</hi> And if you muſt live at a diſtance from him; be not jealous of him, nor ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect his conſtancy. For ſolid love, whoſe root is vertue, can no more dye, than vertue it ſelf; as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> excellently ſpeaks, in a Letter of his to one of our Country-men. When covetouſneſs, ſaith he,<note place="margin">

And they whom pleaſure allures to friendſhip, will make an end of loving, when they are ſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it. And laſtly, they who have a great kindneſs one for another out of a childiſh forwardneſs, or a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venile
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:94275:122"/>
heat, will forſake one another with the ſame levity, that they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced. Our kindneſs relies on ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Pillars; for it was neither hope of gain, nor pleaſure, nor youthful affection, but an honeſt love of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and our common ſtudies which joyned us together. For good men are linkt and chained to each other, by their admiration and eſteem of the ſame things. And ſince the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of vertue is not ſubject to thoſe alterations and changes of fortune that other things undergo: the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of good men muſt needs be perpetual, and is not in danger to ſuffer that decay, which is wont to be the fate of vulgar friendſhip. But that it may be the better preſerved and maintained, it is neceſſary that Friends frequent the company and converſation of each other, as much as they can. For, as <hi>Themiſtius</hi> well notes, <hi>Exerciſe is all in all things: and mutual converſation,</hi>

Let me only caſt in this one Rule, at the bottom of it. It is good to obſerve when any chilneſs and heavineſs creeps upon you, from what quarter it comes. I mean, you muſt follow the ſtream backward to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and inform your ſelf of the cauſe of the alteration. If it be too much company; then, as ſoon as you can, ſeek retirement, and betake your ſelf to private Meditation. If too much ſolitarineſs; then find out ſome agreeable company, or run to your Friend. If the change of weather, then wait, if there be no other relief, till it change again. If you know not what, then believe you ſhall find a remedy in Gods goodneſs, you know not how. And it may give you ſome pleaſure perhaps, when you are moſt indiſpoſed, as to think of

               <p>IN the next place I muſt exhort you, <hi>to exerciſe a great faith in Gods good Providence, which rules in all affairs.</hi> This is of great force to baniſh all perplexing thoughts; and conſequently to make you of a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſpirit, and to be good company for your ſelf when you are alone, or about your neceſſary employments. And it hath not only this oblique a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect upon our Souls, to defend them from that heavineſs &amp; ſadneſs which is too apt to oppreſs them; but is of a more direct and manifeſt influence to comfort and enliven them, on all occaſions. By removing, that is thoſe impediments out of the way, which are a clog and a burden to our ſpirits, and by begetting likewiſe an higher faith in Gods goodneſs to our better part, which takes ſuch care of our lower concernments. For what is it that makes our heart unwilling
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:94275:125"/>
to go to God, and to wait upon him, as <hi>Mary</hi> ſate at our Saviours Feet; but the multitude of buſineſſes wherewith, like <hi>Martha,</hi> we incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and trouble our ſelves? We i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine we can never take care e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough about thoſe things; and when we have done our beſt, ſtill we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſolicitous about the ſucceſs. And ſo our Souls being already fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led &amp; crowded with theſe thoughts, there is no room left to admit of any other, till they be thruſt out.</p>
               <p>And ſuppoſe now our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience begin in this caſe to reprove us, and bid us go to our God; yet if it be that only which urges us, and not a quiet faith in his good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, how do we hear thoſe things calling us off again, and inviting, nay drawing our hearts to them; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed their own? It is nothing elſe that diſtracts us but theſe cares; which are not ejected by faith, but only ſilenced and ſtilled a little by
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:94275:126"/>
natural conſcience, which tells us we do amiſs. Or if they have lain quiet a while, and given us leave to pray to God, and think of better things; how eaſily do they thruſt out all our good Meditations and pious affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when they return again? Nay, how do they eat up and prey on the very Soul it ſelf, as well as on all the good notions which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it?</p>
               <p>If we be neceſſarily engaged then in more affairs, than willingly we would; it is as neceſſary we ſhould be ſtrongly perſwaded of the Care which God takes of all things, that they ſhall go well with thoſe who truſt in him. That ſo we may uſe but a moderate diligence, and not trouble our ſelves about iſſues and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents: and that we may ſave abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of time for better thoughts; and that theſe affairs may not take up our hearts, both while we are in them, and when we are out of them
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:94275:126"/>
too. That's too much familiarity with them, when they will never let us alone. And we ought to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that, though they employ our minds for many Hours, yet, when we have done our work, they may not then ingroſs our time alſo.</p>
               <p>The care of Religion is great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; we need not take upon us the care of the World too. With what reaſon do we complain, that we find it difficult to govern our ſelves, when it ſeems, we think our ſelves meet to govern this World and all? No wonder that we are weary of our work, when we have not only our own to do, but will needs undertake Gods work like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. We may well ſigh and be diſcouraged, when we carry ſuch a vaſt burden upon our Shoulders. There is no end of theſe Cares; which intermix themſelves not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with our particular buſineſſes, but trouble us continually with ſad and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:94275:127"/>
fearful thoughts about the affairs of Nations, and the ſtate of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, wherein our private wealth is embarqued. And this is the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of it, that when we are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by this means, it is a ſin, and not meerly our miſery: becauſe we will meddle with more than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto us. We put our ſelves to an unneceſſary pain, to put our ſelves out of the favour and care of him; who would eaſe us of this burden, by caſting it upon his merciful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. It is an uncomfortable and a ſinful condition; which is aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by this, that it is a needleſs and a bold intruſion into his buſineſs who governs the World. It is as if I ſhould be very ſolicitous, whether the Sun will ſhine to morrow or not; when I have occaſion to ſtay all Day about my affairs at home.</p>
               <p>Let us do what concerns us; and leave God to diſpoſe of all the reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And let us believe that he will aſſiſt
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:94275:127"/>
us in our diſpatches; and a great deal the more, if we will not ſtretch our ſelves to meddle beyond our line. He will help us to do what we ought, when we do no more than we ſhould. When we are not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, I mean, with fear that we ſhall not be able to go thorough our employments; and when we are not too careful what will become of them, after we have finiſhed our work. God will take care that we ſhall do them, and that they ſhall have the beſt ſucceſs, when they are done. Look upon your ſelf as a part of the World, and upon God as the Governour of the whole. And then by faith in him, make your ſelf (as it were) a part of himſelf; that ſo he may have a particular concernment in your affairs. Look upon your ſelf not only as one of his Family, and therefore under his General Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: but alſo as one of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for whoſe good he will more than ordinarily provide. And be
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:94275:128"/>
always confident he will provide the better for you; becauſe you truſt him, and leave your ſelf wholly to his Wiſdom and Kindneſs.</p>
               <p>I could entertain you here with a delightful Diſcourſe on this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; were it not that I would not burden you, as I ſaid before, with too great a Book. Let me only adviſe you of this, which ſhall excuſe me from adding a <hi>Prayer</hi> at the end of this Diſcourſe; eſpecially ſince you know where to find one in another place. That as it is moſt for our eaſe to recommend all we have and do to Gods good providence, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to reſt ſatisfied in what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines: ſo the moſt effectual courſe to obtain this reſignation to him and confidence in him, is rather to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it in our Devotions by acts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation and expreſſions of our truſt in his great goodneſs, than to be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning him continually to beſtow upon us this grace. Say therefore,

               <p>
                  <hi>Thou art my hope, O Lord, thou art my truſt from my Youth. I truſt in the Mercy of God,</hi>

                  <hi>for ever and ever. Mine eyes are unto thee, O God the Lord: I will hope continually, and will yet praiſe Thee more and more. What time I am afraid, I will truſt in thee.

Goodneſs is the greateſt treaſure; thy Truth and Faithfulneſs is my beſt ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; thy gracious Promiſes and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Providence is my comfort; thy Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is my ſatisfaction in all events and accidents; thy Power is my ſupport, protection, and ſafeguard. Lead me whither thou pleaſeſt; and I will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee with a chearful heart. I refuſe nothing which comes from thy hands, O moſt loving Father. I ſubmit to thy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and hope that all things ſhall work together for my good. And I truſt in thy grace, that I ſhall always do as I do now: ſtedfaſtly adhering thus unto thee, and never ſuffering any thing that befalls me, to pull me away from this humble faith in thy wiſe and almighty Goodneſs; to which I refer my ſelf, now and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the more to awaken you to this; let me tell you, <hi>My Friend,</hi> that we find examples of it, even in the Heathens themſelves, who, in a ſtrange fit of devotion, have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:94275:129"/>
cryed out on this faſhion.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>O man, what doſt thou? Why doſt thou not free thy ſelf from all this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Adventure at laſt,<note place="margin">Arrian. Epict. L. <hi>2.</hi> Cap. <hi>16.</hi>
                     </note> with eyes lifted up to God, to ſay unto him. Uſe me at thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, O God, for the time to come. Thou haſt my perfect conſent. I am of the ſame mind that thou art. I have a mind to nothing but what thou thinkeſt good. Wilt thou have me bear an Office; or ſhall I lead a private life? Muſt I ſtay or muſt I fly? Shall I be poor or ſhall I be rich? I am ready to obey. I will defend thee, againſt all the World. I will apologize for thy providence about theſe things, to every body. I ſay that all is good, becauſe thou art ſo.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus they exhorted men to follow God chearfully, in a belief that he is Wiſe and Good: for we can never
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:94275:130"/>
be happy ſaid they if we follow him ſighing and groaning; as a man doth one that is ſtronger than he, who pulls him after him, when he hath no mind to go. <q>Let us begin every thing (ſaith the ſame Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher in another place) without too much deſire or averſation. Let us not incline to this, or to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. But behave our ſelves like a Traveller, who when he comes to two ways, asks him whom he meets next, which of thoſe he ſhall take to ſuch a place: having no inclination to the right hand rather than to the left; but deſiring only to know the true and direct way that will carry him to his Journeys end. Juſt ſo muſt we <hi>come to God, as to a Guide;</hi> as to one who ſhall diſpoſe of our motions as he pleaſes. We muſt not look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, and deſire of him this or the other thing which we fancy. We muſt not direct Him what courſe he ſhould take with us; nor
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:94275:130"/>
deſire him to ſhow us this rather than that: but embrace that which he propoſes; and deſire only he will conduct us in the right way to happineſs. This is our duty and our ſafety. Whereas now you ſhall ſee Men run to him, and ſay, <hi>Lord have Mercy upon me;</hi> deliver me from ſuch and ſuch a thing. Wretch that thou art! Wouldſt thou have any thing but what is beſt? And who can tell what that is? Is there any thing beſt, but that which ſeems ſo to God? Why then doſt thou endeavour, as much as in thee lies, to corrupt him who is to judg; and to ſeduce Him who is thy Counſellour; and to move him, by thy cries, to do otherways than he thinks good?</q> Ceaſe theſe cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and do not urge him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to thy deſires; but ſuffer him to follow his own Wiſdom. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any delight to him to croſs and vex us. If what we are inclined to deſire be conformable to his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:94275:131"/>
he will not deny it us, meerly becauſe we are inclined to deſire it. But he will give us that which is good in his eyes, as the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks; And what would we have more? Will it not ſuffice us to have our own hearts deſire? And what ſhould that be, if we are well advis'd, but this; that we may have what unſearchable Wiſdom, united with Infinite Power and Goodneſs, ſhall think to be fitteſt for us, and moſt convenient? Of this we need not doubt: And this is ſufficient for any Mans ſatisfaction.</p>

               <p>We are very ſure that God hath inſtituted, by his particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, this Holy Feaſt (like to which none ever was, and which we may celebrate as oft as we pleaſe) upon the Body and Blood of his dear Son. Whereby a great love, ſure, will be begot in our hearts to him and his ſervice, whoſe gueſts we are; and at whoſe coſt the entertainment is made, meerly out of his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary grace and royal favour towards us. This ſure will be a ſingular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment and reſtorative to our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; when we grow weary, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſpent in the work of our Lord. The ſweetneſs of this will be like
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:94275:133"/>
Wine to the Heart, or like Marrow and Fatneſs to the Bones. It will ſtir us up, when we are liſtleſs; and comfort us, when we are ſad; and put life into us, when we are dead; and make us not only able but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be Religious, being both our pleaſure and our food.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seneca,</hi> ſpeaking of times of relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and reſt from labours, ſaith, he knew ſome great Men,<note place="margin">L. de tranq. animi.</note> who once a Moneth would give themſelves a Day of play; and others that every Day would allow ſome Hours, wherein they would not ſo much as write a Letter, or meddle with any thing that had the ſhow of buſineſs. If we in like manner did, though not every Day, yet every Moneth take this ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt; if out of love to Chriſt, and conſideration of our own neceſſities, we did lay aſide all other thoughts, and give up our ſelves to thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Meditations, which here
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:94275:133"/>
preſent themſelves unto us; it would eaſe us of many cares and troubles, and make us more chearfully do the will of God at other times, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us to attend the whole buſineſs of Religion as the pleaſure rather than the labour of our life.</p>
               <p>But if you be caſt into a place, where you have not the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo frequently to celebrate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Chriſt's death, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the outward and viſible ſigns and pledges of his Divine Grace; then you may the oftner communicate with him ſpiritually in your own heart, and repreſent his dying love as lively as you can to it, in your retired thoughts: Beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to accept of your unfeigned deſires, to make him your publick acknowledgments, and to joyn with all thoſe pious Souls, which are then met together throughout the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World to ſhow forth his praiſe, and to offer up themſelves in holy
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:94275:134"/>
love to him, and to our bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer Chriſt Jeſus. For which purpoſe I would adviſe you to make uſe of all ſuch Meditations, Prayers, and Thankſgivings, as are wont to attend thoſe Solemnities: altering only thoſe words which relate to your actual receiving at the Table of the Lord.</p>
               <p>The profit of ſuch a frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of our Lord one way or other, will be exceeding great; for the ſecuring your duty, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all thoſe Counſels, which I have given you, the more effectual. It will put you in mind of the worth and dignity of your Soul; for which Chriſt hath done and ſuffered ſo much, and on whom he beſtows ſuch precious tokens of his love. It will quicken your love to him, which is the life of Religion. You ſhall taſte how ſweet it is, beyond all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, to be Religious; whereby we have ſuch hope in God. There you
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:94275:134"/>
ſhall be remembred how gainful it is to be good, beyond all the purchaſes of this World; for Chriſt imparts himſelf to you and all his benefits. There you pray with the greateſt devotion, and offer up Spiritual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices; and you repreſent alſo the Sacrifice of Chriſt, to prevail for bleſſings for you. And there you are moſt likely to have the moſt plentiful communications of God's Holy Spirit to you; and to feel your Heart dilated in the largeſt affection unto Him. There you confirm your promiſes to God; and he ſeales his to you. You cannot there be of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother judgment, if you would, than this; that ſince Chriſt dyed to give you life, you ought not henceforth to live to your ſelf, but unto him which dyed for you, and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>This, I make no doubt, is one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why thoſe promiſes wherein Men ſtand engaged to God, are no
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:94275:135"/>
better performed; becauſe they do not frequently repeat this holy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the exerciſe of which, they find their hearts, at preſent, fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved for God and goodneſs. This is the cauſe that they waver again; and all their Promiſes and Vows wherein they bind themſelves, fall off like cords of vanity. Whereas, did they upon all occaſions commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with our Saviour, they would find their reſolutions grow ſo ſtrong and ſtedfaſt, that no temptation would be able to break them. They would be like Bands of Iron, or Chains, rather, of Gold; that would hold them for ever to their duty. You have heard, I believe, the ſtory of <hi>Mithridates;</hi> who by often uſe of the Antidote which he invented, ſo fortified his Spirits; that they reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the force of all Poyſon. Inſomuch that when, to avoid the <hi>Roman</hi> ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he would have diſpatched himſelf by a ſtrong venemous draught, he was not able to effect it. Such a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:94275:135"/>
vertue you will find, in the frequent devout receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Chriſts Body and Blood. It will ſecure the life of your Soul; confirm your ſtrength; arm you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the bitings of the old Serpent; and make it, in a manner, impoſſible for you to be impoiſoned, by any naughty affections.</p>
               <p>But I have writ ſo much, on this Subject, in other Books already, that I need not ſay any more of it here. You find, I hope, thoſe Treatiſes uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the ſtirring up Devotion, and to the making a Soul more forward and unwearied in Gods ſervice. And there likewiſe you may meet with a particular Prayer, for <hi>Love to the Holy Communion:</hi> wherefore let me pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, without any ſtop, to the next Advice.</p>

               <p>IF ſo be you find your Dulneſs and backwardneſs to your Duty, at any time, continue ſo long and increaſe ſo much, that you are afraid there is danger in it, and it may prove perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to your Soul; then go and <hi>take counſel of your ſpiritual Phyſician,</hi> to whom I would have you open your caſe, as plainly and fully as you can. There is no ſmall ſafety in taking a good Guide by the hand, at all turns, as you walk in your way to Heaven. But then eſpecially it is a neceſſary piece of wiſdome to ask about your way betime, when you fear you may be out: and to open your grief at the beginning, when you are woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with ſad apprehenſions, before the Sore feſter.</p>
               <p>And if your Phyſician or Director could be your Friend alſo, then you would have a three-fold advantage
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:94275:136"/>
for your relief; by the advice of a good Man, a Friend, and one of Gods Officers. For I believe the ſame words ſpoken by him, and by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are not the ſame. They are the more acceptable when they come from a Friend; and carry the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Authority from the Mouth of God's Miniſter. And therefore be no more backward to reveal the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of your Soul to Him, when it is beyond your own skill to heal your diſtempers; than you are to let a Phyſician know thoſe Maladies in your Body, which muſt be beholden to him for a Cure.</p>
               <p>He may furniſh you with incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, if you need quickning. He may revive you, when you ſeem as if you were a dying. He may lend you his ſupports and comforts, when you are feeble and diſconſolate. He may help you to diſtinguiſh between your fears and real dangers; between your weakneſs and your wilfulneſs;
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:94275:137"/>
between your lazineſs, and your cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; between your bodily and your ſpiritual infirmities. He will be as a good Pilot to ſteer your Soul, when you are toſſed (like a Ship in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Sea and a dark Night) in the doubts and waverings of your own Mind. Yea, in your beſt eſtate, he may be of ſingular uſe to you, to keep you within the bounds of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; that you be not over-born with the too violent guſts of your own awakned affections and deſires. A Ship needs a Pilot in fair weather, as well as in a ſtorm: when it hath a proſperous Gale, as well as when it is driven with rough and furious, or with croſs Winds. She may be in danger then by undiſcovered Shelves and Rocks, or by carrying too great a Sail; as in the other caſe ſhe is, by Tempeſts and Hurricans, which tear her Sails in pieces. And ſhe muſt never ſail at randome, but ſteer to ſome certain Port; which cannot be performed without his direction,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:94275:137"/>
and muſt be the effect of his skilful guidance. Even ſo it is in the caſe of our Souls; which may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd in our ſpiritual fervours, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we have ſome to manage us. When all things favour us, we may ſtrain our ſelves too much and be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſet, if there be none to govern our Motions. Our zeal may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet, if we have not a wiſe and faithful Adviſer. It may ſpend it ſelf on little things, or thoſe that are unprofitable, if there be none to give directions about it: Or it may drive at no certain end, but flote as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, unleſs ſome body ſit at the ſtern, to order and rule it. We may hoyſe up too high a Sayle, and by making too much haſt be indanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; if we have not the aſſiſtance of one that can judg what we are able to bear, and that ſhall ſometimes ſlacken us in our too ſpeedy courſe. In ſhort, a great deal of time may be ſpent in ſome caſes, to ſmall purpoſe; without a greater prudence than our
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:94275:138"/>
own, to husband it, and lay it out for us.</p>
               <p>I muſt commend to you therefore the Rule, which one of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors gave his Scholars (half of which you have had already) <hi>Provide your ſelf,</hi>

                  <hi>of a good Teacher, and a good School-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</hi> A good Guide, and a good Companion, you will find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding uſeful to you. Eſpecially the Guide; who may ſometime be your Companion too. Such the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture calls our <hi>Leaders</hi> (Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers we render it, XIII. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 17) the Conductors, and Governours of our motions, in the way to Heaven. Thoſe that take us by the hand, as I ſaid, both to guide and to ſupport us: by their advice and counſel; by their admonitions and exhortations; by Prayer and Bleſſing; by comforts and ſpiritual conſolations. They are Miniſters of the Word; Expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the holy Books; Monitors to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:94275:138"/>
our Duty; Mediators with God; and Diſpenſers of the Myſteries of Salvation: And therefore it will not be ſafe to travel without the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of ſome or other of them. To whom when you have committed your ſelf, look upon Him as your good Genius, or tutelar <hi>Angel,</hi> (by which Name the higheſt Miniſters in the Church are called) whom you would have as near you as you can; and in whoſe company, and under whoſe care and tuition you may hope to arrive in ſafety at your Journeys end. To him it will be neceſſary to repair on all occaſions, that He may inſtruct and teach you in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you are Ignorant; or awaken you, when you are ſleepy; or refreſh and chear you, when you are weary; or cure you, when you are ſick and ill at eaſe; or reſolve you in your doubts; or quicken your dulneſs; or bridle your fervours; in ſhort, that he may illuminate your mind to make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between truth and falſhood,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:94275:139"/>
reality and appearance, good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and excite your will to embrace the one, and refuſe the other, with a conſtant affection.</p>
               <p>For ſuppoſe (to give an inſtance) any Man ſhould make a tendry to you of ſome Principles, which he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to prove you ought to receive, as Articles of the Chriſtian Faith: How can you be ſecure that you ſhall not drink in ſome poyſonous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, under the ſugared Name of Truth; unleſs you take advice of thoſe, that have their Senſes more exerciſed to diſcern, than your ſelf? And ſo, in all other caſes, know for certain, you will never be ſo well able to inſtruct and counſel your ſelf, as they: never ſo well underſtand the Sacred Books, as by the help of their Interpretations: nor be ſo well ſatisfied you do your duty, as by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with them, whoſe work it is to ſearch and make enquiries into the Laws of God. Every Man may
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:94275:139"/>
know ſo much of the Law, as to keep him from quarrelling, or treſpaſſing upon his Neighbours: But he will not depend upon his own knowledg in every thing that concerns his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, eſpecially when any part of it is in diſpute, or he would have it well ſetled according to his hearts deſire. And though ſome ordinary things in Phyſick, the vertues of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Herbs and Plants, may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by any Body with a little pains; yet none will truſt themſelves, or their next Neighbours, in caſe of a ſharp Diſeaſe, but ſend, if they be able, for a Man of the greateſt repute in his faculty, to look after their health, and adminiſter Medicines to them. Juſt thus it is in the caſe of our Souls: it is too much preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and careleſs confidence, to rely upon our own counſel alone, in the ſetlement of our everlaſting eſtate, or in the Cure of thoſe Diſorders and Diſtempers in our mind which threaten danger; we ought to take
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:94275:140"/>
good advice, and, for fear of miſtake, have the judgement of ſome more skilful Perſon to ſecure us, as well as our own.</p>
               <p>And indeed, from hence you may learn what account God makes of your Soul (and how highly it ought to be valued by your ſelf) for the ſafety of which He hath made ſuch careful and plentiful proviſion. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, next to the gift of his Son, and of the Holy-Ghoſt, ſetled an order of men to miniſter unto Souls; to look after them, and ſee that they do not periſh, for want of inſtruction or good advice. As he would have our Saviour lay down his life for them, ſo he hath, thereby, made him a moſt compaſſionate High-Prieſt, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred him to a Kingdome; which is nothing elſe but an Office, Power and Authority, to take care of Souls, and do them good continually. By vertue of which, he hath committed Authority unto others in a perpetual
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:94275:140"/>
ſucceſſion, that they ſhould <hi>watch for Mens ſouls,</hi> as the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks: declaring to them their own worth, and his love; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafting that Word in them, which is able to ſave them; calling them to repentance; eſtabliſhing them in the Faith; incouraging their Progreſs in vertue; ordering their goings; feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with his bleſſed Body and Blood; abſolving them from their ſins; aſſiſting them in their laſt ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that they may finiſh their courſe with joy.</p>
               <p>This is the effect of a peculiar kindneſs to Souls. He hath not dealt ſo with our Bodies: for we never heard of a Company of Men appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God to invent pleaſures and contrive ways for the feaſting of our Senſes. There are none ſeparated and ſet apart by him, to teach the World how to get riches, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Eſtates, and fill their Coffers. But all the wiſdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:94275:141"/>
is employed to other purpoſes: having ordained Men to teach us how to live above thoſe things, and to repleniſh our minds with his knowledg, and our wills with his love. This he hath made their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant function, and perpetual employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the Worlds end.</p>
               <p>And therefore be not ſlack to uſe their Miniſtry, nor doubt of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God upon it. But have ſo much love to your Soul, as to apply your ſelf to them for aſſiſtance, who are particularly concerned to give it: and ſo much love to God, as to be confident he will make thoſe means ſucceſsful, which he hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ordained for your good.</p>

                  <p>I ſee, O Lord, how dear and precious our Souls are in thy ſight: for which our Saviour hath done and ſuffered ſo much, and imployeth still the care and pains of ſo many Perſons to take the charge and overſight of them, and guide them unto their Reſt.

               <p>BUT when you are in your beſt moods, and think your ſelf fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt off from danger, it will be good to <hi>exerciſe an Holy Fear and Jealouſie over your ſelf;</hi> leaſt you ſhould give way to any thing, which may make you grow worſe. Remember how falſe and treacherous the conquered Enemy is; and therefore it ought to be narrowly watcht. Though it promiſe fair, Remember that you muſt not truſt it without a conſtant Guard. And mark the leaſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of an evil, for fear, if they be ſlighted as ſmall faults, they draw you into a greater. Though we muſt not be dejected for our little irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities, yet we muſt not paſs them over neither, without a ſerious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance. If a Father laugh or ſmile when he chides a wanton Child, it is ſo far from being a check to his follies, that it doth the more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:94275:143"/>
him to play thoſe idle tricks, for which he is reproved. And ſo it is to be feared we ſhall find our ſelves diſpoſed; if we be not in good earneſt diſpleaſed at our ſelves for any thing that borders upon Vice, and do not reprove our ſelves ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly for making too much uſe of our liberty: We may be in danger by this mildneſs and gentleneſs, to take the boldneſs to proceed to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tranſgreſſions.</p>
               <p>But I may ſeem to forget to whom I write; and, conſidering what a great quantity you have of this fear, I had need give it a large daſh of ſome other mixture; leaſt it turn into timorouſneſs, and hurt your Soul. And this indeed is the skill we ſhould all learn; to behave our ſelves with ſuch caution and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the exerciſe of fear, that it do not make us Superſtitious, nor, through a deſpondency of Spirit, caſt us into that dulneſs and weakneſs,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:94275:144"/>
which we are ſtriving to avoid. You muſt let your <hi>Fear</hi> therefore be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with ſo much of a Divine <hi>Faith;</hi> that like heat and moiſture, they may make up one healthful conſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith in God,</hi> I ſay, is another thing that you muſt carefully and daily foſter in your Soul; if you would be conſtant in his Service. Be verily perſwaded that he loves you infinitely more, than you love him; and therefore is more deſirous, than you can be, to ſee you do well and continue in well doing to the end. Think that his eye is upon you; that his arm is under you; that he is as near to you as you are to your ſelf: for, in all regards, we live and move, and have our Being in Him. Think therefore that you behold Him, the Father of Lights, ſending in rayes of light into your mind, as you ſee the Sun looking in at your Windows, and filling the room with its chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:94275:144"/>
beams: and that you feel Him pouring in life conſtantly into your will, as the Heart ſpurts out blood into all the Arteries of the Body. Never entertain ſuch a thought of Him, as though he was willing to deſert you, and caſt you out of his friendſhip; now that he hath done ſo much for you, and you have been ſo long acquainted. By no means hearken to any jealous thoughts, that are but whiſpered of his goodneſs; whatſoever the jealouſies be, which you have of your own inconſtancy.</p>
               <p>Was it not He that called us, when we were in horrid darkneſs and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs of him; bending all our thoughts and deſires to our own ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and his diſhonour? Was it not He that aſſiſted us to get the victory over ſo many Enemies? Who but He is it, that hath hitherto enabled us, in our ſtudy to live vertuouſly, and pleaſe Him in all things? What ſhould now move him to alter his

mind? After ſuch numerous tokens of his love, what is it ſhould make him hate us? Will he bear with no weakneſſes; or ſhall a fault that we have committed, wholly alienate his affection from us? If when we lay in our filthineſs, he took pitty on us, pulled us out of the Mire, and laid us in his boſome; now that we are waſhed all over, will he ſhake us off, and caſt us out of his embraces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Feet (as our Lord ſpeaks) ſtill need ſome waſhing? He that invited us ſo kindly when we were ſtrangers, and took us into his houſe, and made us become not his ſervants only, but his Children; will he now turn us out of doors preſently, and thruſt us into the wide world again, becauſe we have offended Him? When we had no ſtrength, did he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire us, and hath he thus long ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly followed us, and trained us up in his ſervice; and will he now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the conduct of us, and abandon us to the mercy of our Enemies?
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:94275:145"/>
Why did He then with ſo much labour purchaſe our love? Why hath He been at ſuch vaſt expence on our account? Why would He take ſuch incredible care to loſe us, when we might have periſhed by his no care of us?</p>
               <p>O unworthy thoughts of ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Maſter, ſo loving a Father, ſo tender a Husband! Rather let us think the Sun may refuſe to riſe and ſhine upon us, or the Sea may be dryed up; than imagine that He ſhould be willing to caſt us into our former darkneſs, and not let the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of his grace ſtill run towards us. Let us at leaſt make him as good as an ordinary Mother, who not only ſuckles her Child when it is young, and indures many tedious Days and weariſome Nights, in the midſt of its cries and froward hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; but likewiſe loves and looks after it when it can go alone, and make ſome proviſion for its own
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:94275:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
good and ſafety. Far be it from us to make him like the ſilly Birds, that attend their young no longer than they are in the Neſt, and leave them to ſhift for themſelves, when they have once taught them to uſe their Wings. Will not the Divine love think you indure far more unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, peeviſhneſs and wayward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in our hearts, when our grace is but in its infancy and childhood; than a tender Mother indures in her little one, before it can ſpeak and tell its mind? And will he not bear then with ſome indiſcretions or faults af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; but caſt us out as <hi>Sarah</hi> did <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and the Handmaid into a Wilderneſs; where there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for us? Nay, will He that took compaſſion on that poor out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt and his Mother, to whom he ſent his Angel for their preſervation, leave his dear Children to become a prey to the wild Beaſts of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert? Far be it from the Father of Mercies, the God of love and all
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:94275:146"/>
comfort, to deal ſo with us.</p>
               <p>And let me tell you that, the more confidence we repoſe in his love, the more he hates to uſe us ſo unkindly. What man is there ſo hard-hearted, that ſeeing his Neighbour ready to fall and hurt himſelf, will deny him his help, and with-draw his ſupport; eſpecially when he falls into his armes, and deſires wholly to lean Himſelf on his Breaſt? Who can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to fail a Man, and let him be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; that comes and puts his eſtate and his life into his hands, though otherwiſe he be undeſerving? If a poor Bird fly to us for protection from the ravenous Kite that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes it, Can we find in our hearts to throw it into its Enemies claws? Who can then ſuſpect, that God, who hath declared himſelf otherwayes willing to do us good, ſhould then caſt us off and forſake us, when we altogether rely upon his goodneſs, clemency, wiſdom and power to help
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:94275:147"/>
and relieve us? When we fly to none elſe for ſhelter; when we ſay as <hi>David</hi> doth (LXII. Pſal. 1, 2, 5.) <hi>Truly my Soul waiteth upon God, from Him cometh my Salvation: He only is my rock and my ſalvation, he is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: The rock of my strength, and my refuge is in God:</hi> Who can let it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his thoughts, that then He will turn away from us, and ſuffer us to be <hi>greatly moved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But more than this; there is no Man among us, unleſs he will make himſelf moſt infamous, can fail and deſert another; who, upon his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt invitation, and kind proffers of ſecurity, comes and puts Himſelf wholly under his Wing, and truſts to his Covert for ſafe protection. Men are not arrived yet at ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity; but are aſhamed to be ſo barbarous, as to inveigle Men with fair promiſes and ſhows of kindneſs to come, and take Sanctuary with them, and then betray them. Let
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:94275:147"/>
the Lord of Heaven then never be held in the leaſt ſuſpicion of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs as well as unkindneſs to us, whom he hath invited and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to confide and put their whole truſt in him. Never ſo much as imagine, that he will diſappoint thoſe good Souls, that rely and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on nothing in their obedience to him, but his undoubted promiſes. Let it not come into any our minds (or let the thought of it be abhorred and rejected with indignation) that after he hath made us ſuch aſſurances of his Care and Love, he will break his word, and let us fall, when we have faſt hold of his Mercy and his Truth. Men may prove falſe and treacherous; there may be ſuch Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters whoſe kindneſſes are but flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and their invitations but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnarements: But faithfulneſs it ſelf cannot be unfaithful; God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot mock us; His infinite perfections will not let Him have any unworthy deſigns upon us, or any ways delude us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:94275:148"/>What? deceive a Confident, and fail a Friend?— Such God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to eſteem us, when we devote our ſelves in love to his Service: which is a farther conſideration, of greater moment than any elſe; to ſecure us of his faithful kindneſs. For if our heart will not ſerve us, to let a poor neighbour fall to the ground; when we can eaſily ſupport him; much leſs to deſert one that hath intirely truſted us with all he hath, and who by our deſire repoſed this truſt in us; then leaſt of all can we be enclined to abandon the care of him, who by long converſation with us, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of us, is become our Friend. This gives him a new and a ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er title to all that we can do for him; and becauſe we have been ſo kind, will be the beſt reaſon why we ſhould continue to be ſo ſtill. Conſider but the Natural works of God; doth He begin to form the life of a Child in the Womb, and leave it before it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a perfect Creature? yea, if it
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:94275:148"/>
be but a Chicken in an Egg, doth he not bring it to its full growth, unleſs (in either caſe) ſomething extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary hinder? Why then ſhould we dream that he will deſiſt, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the formation of his Son Chriſt in us; the lively Image of whom he hath already begun? It muſt be ſome ſtrange violence which we offer to our ſelves, ſome very ill uſe of our Souls, and great ſtraining of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that can make us miſcarry.</p>
               <p>I have askt the Queſtion, you know, elſewhere, and let me briefly repeat it again in this place; Who was it that bid S. <hi>Peter</hi> to walk upon the Water? At whoſe command did his body, though apt to ſink like a ſtone, tread in that ſoft and yielding Element? Was it not our Saviour that ſaid, <hi>Come?</hi> and that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. His word made the floods that they could not ſwallow him up. He felt no more difficulty or danger in thoſe paths, as long as he believed
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:94275:149"/>
our Saviour's Power, than if he had walked on dry Land. Then it was that he began to ſink, when his faith turned into fear. His heart ſunk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his body; and his courage yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Waters. Juſt ſo it is with us, who are compounded of earthly materials, and yet are bid to wade through this world to heaven. A Miracle it is, that our dull Nature which hangs downward, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ſink into the ſoft delights of ſenſe, ſhould be able to look up above, and not be ſwallowed up in a gulph of ſin and miſery. For this we ſtand indebted to the Divine Power, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding and aiding our weakneſs. And He that hath called us, as he did <hi>Peter,</hi> and bid us come to him, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues his mighty word with us, and bids us go on in the ways of his Commandements. What need we fear, as long as we have him in our company, to go along with us? And when is it that we are in danger of drowning; but when we grow dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:94275:149"/>
(as St. <hi>Peter</hi> did) and our minds are fixed more upon the Wind and the Waves, the hardſhips and the hazards, that threaten us, than upon the grace and power of our Lord, that takes the charge of us?</p>
               <p>And yet if through our fearfulneſs and diſtruſt, we chance to ſtagger and waver in our reſolution; we are not utterly undone, but have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy very near us. Our Lord will put forth his hand, even in the midſt of theſe fears, and hold us up, as he did that faint-hearted Diſciple of his, when we cry out to Him in his words, <hi>Lord ſave me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſtoutly reſolved by an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, that ſeeing all diſorders in man ariſe, partly from the weakneſs of thoſe reaſons that are in his mind, and partly from the exceſſive abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of groſs matter, to which he is chained; and ſeeing thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons &amp; Notions are Divine, and near

Theſe very motions derive
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:94275:150"/>
themſelves from Heaven; and may as confidently expect to be ſuccoured from thence, as a Child to receive relief from his Parents when he is in diſtreſs, and when, by his order alſo, he is ingaged to apply his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to a mighty work, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his help, he knows, cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. It is incredible that the Father of Mercies ſhould expoſe that which is born of him, to be undone and periſh; which will certainly be the fate of all that is good in us, without his conſtant care and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for its preſervation. Do not doubt, but God will look after his own, and ſee that the little portion of goodneſs which is remaining in this World, be countenanced and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged. In aſſurance of which, you may addreſs your ſelf unto him, after this manner.</p>

               <p>AND now is there any need to uſe many words, to ſhow how much force there is in the <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Death</hi> to make you lively? It is the common opinion, that all things intend themſelves more earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly, and act in the extremity, when they meet with their contrary, which threatens their deſtruction: As Springs are hotteſt in the coldeſt ſeaſons, and Fire it ſelf moſt ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in froſty weather. Even ſo if we ſet Death very ſeriouſly before our mind, and laid the thoughts of it cloſe to our heart, would it cauſe our life to be more full of Life. We ſhould gather together all our might, to do as much as we can; if we lookt upon our ſelves, as going to the Grave; where there is no work to be done at all.</p>
               <p>The mind of Man is too apt to
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:94275:153"/>
feed it ſelf with the fancy of ſeveral pleaſures, that either Nature affords, or Art hath invented. Among all which a good natur'd mind findes none ſo delicious; as the conceit which frequently ſtarts up in it, of the exceſſive pleaſure he ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, were he always in the company of a Friend whom he loves intirely, and might they ſpend their days, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as they liſt themſelves, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all their Hours according to their own inclinations. But if a thought of Death interpoſe it ſelf when he is in the height of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, it daſhes all theſe fine Bubbles of the imagination in pieces: All's gone, and vaniſhes into a ſigh; or there is nothing of them remains, but a drop as big as a tear. And therefore if it be ſo ſharp a curb to the forwardneſs of our deſires, and ſerve as a Bridle to hold in our head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong paſſions; we may uſe it alſo as a good Spur to prick them on, when they are too ſluggiſh, and to
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:94275:154"/>
ſtir them up when they have no liſt to move at all.</p>
               <p>When we are ready to fall aſleep, did we but think of dying, it would make us ſtart and ſay; Who would ſleep and dream away his time in this manner, when, for any thing he knows, he hath but a few Sands left in his Glaſs? Death is coming to draw the Curtains about me, and to make my Bed for me in the duſt; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake then, up, and be doing, becauſe there is a long Night near at hand, wherein we muſt reſt and not work. And is it not a very great grace, if for ſo ſmall, ſo ſhort a work, we ſhall receive ſo vaſt, ſo long a reward? It is a great ſhame to ſtand all the day idle, if it be but for this very reaſon, that our beſt diligence, though it could be continued for many more years than it is like to be, can never deſerve ſuch a recompence.</p>
               <p>Place your ſelf therefore, as if you
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:94275:154"/>
were upon your Death-bed, and think with what ardent deſires, with what paſſionate groans, with what an heartful of ſighs, you would ſeek after God, if your Soul was juſt taking its flight out of this Body; and perhaps this will ſend it out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand in the like ſighs and groans, which will help to waft You to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven. Juſt as when a man is to write to the deareſt Friend he hath in the World, and thinks they are the laſt Lines that ever he ſhall ſend him; his very heart diſſolves and drops it ſelf into his Pen: So would all our affections melt and flow forth towards God, if we ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our ſelves, as if we ſhould never ſpeak to him more with a Tongue of Fleſh, nor look upon him through theſe Windows of Clay; but ſhould ſhortly dwell in ſilence, and go down into the Houſe of Darkneſs. O how would our Souls <hi>thirſt for God</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>for the living God!</hi> How much ſhould we love him, and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:94275:155"/>
endeavour to confirm our friendſhip with him! that when our Bodies are diſpoſed of into the Earth, our Souls might ſtill live and rejoyce with Him in Heaven; expecting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a bleſſed Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>And if you ſay that in this ſtate of dulneſs, that I am ſpeaking of, a Soul is fit to think of nothing; this thing will tell you how it alarms the heart, and makes it muſter up its thoughts, and collect its ſcattered Forces, that it may be in a readineſs to receive the approaches of Death, and its aſſault upon us. And the thoughts of it, at ſuch a time, are the more natural and eaſie, becauſe there is nothing more like to Death than this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active and ſluggiſh temper; when the Soul ſeems as if it were buried in the Body, and intombed already in this Vault of Fleſh.</p>
               <p>And it would be very eaſy to ſhow how much every one of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:94275:155"/>
counſels would be improved, by our frequent converſation, on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, with our Graves. It would excite our minds to enquire after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother World; and make us very deſirous to find it out. It would raiſe our eſteem of the great love of God, who hath given us ſuch aſſurance of a never dying life. It would carry away our thoughts from this Earth, as not the place of our ſetled abode. It would preſently ſend them above; and bid them ſee the pleaſures which we do but imagine here, in their full growth, and perfection of joy and happineſs there. O how delightful would Religion and Vertue be unto us, which is the only thing we can carry away with us? How curious ſhould we be to judg aright, that Death may not be the firſt thing that ſhall undeceive us? How would it open our heart, as I ſaid, to pour out it ſelf in devout affections to God? and what a comfort would theſe be to us, if the records of them were
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:94275:156"/>
ſpread before us at our dying hour? This is ſo far from being an enemy to chearfulneſs, that it is a forcible reaſon why we ſhould freely enjoy all that God hath given us, becauſe we muſt ſhortly leave it. Our Friends alſo we ſhall therefore be enclined to embrace more ardently, and do them the more good, and covet their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, becauſe we have not long to ſtay with them. For when I ſaid the thoughts of Death are apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain our too forward deſires, I did not mean that it checks or abates our love to our Friends. No; <hi>Love is strong as Death, and hard</hi> (or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yielding) <hi>as the Grave: the Coals thereof are Coals of Fire, a moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment flame;</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, VIII. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. It burns, that is, like the Fire on the Altar (for in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> the laſt words are; <hi>the Flame of God</hi>) which came down from Heaven and never went out. Nothing can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer it, no not Death which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers all Fleſh. That can only teach
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:94275:156"/>
us not to place our chief contentment in any thing here; no, not in the beſt good in this World, though never ſo dear unto us: becauſe it may ſhortly leave us only its ſhaddow, the image of it in our memory; which putting us in mind of our forepaſt pleaſures will make us ſo much the more ſad, if we have not hope to find that good improved, by its departure from us, in another World. And is not the uſe of a Friend then moſt viſible, when we think of our departure, by whom as I ſaid, in one of the former Diſcourſes, we ſhall ſtill remain with thoſe whom we leave behind? But what Friend is there like to our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord; whoſe love we ſhall the oftner remember by commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Death, if we think of our own? We cannot chuſe but be exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to prepare our ſelves thereby, for an happy and chearful diſſolution. And why ſhould we not truſt God with all we have for a little time, whom we muſt ſhortly intruſt with
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:94275:157"/>
Soul and Body to all Eternity? But I liſt not to prolong this Diſcourſe, with ſuch collections as theſe; which I will leave to your own thoughts, with this Prayer, wherewith you may awaken your mind, when you find it neceſſary.</p>

                  <p>THou art worthy, O Lord, of all Praiſe, Glory and Honour; by whoſe Omnipotent Will, and for whoſe pleaſure, all things in Heaven and Earth were created, and by whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Providence they are continually maintained and preſerved. They ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt endure: yea all of them ſhall wax old like a Garment:<note place="margin">102. Pſal. 26.73.26.</note> as a Veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed. But thou art the ſame,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:94275:157"/>
and thy Years ſhall have no end. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate my ſelf before Thee in an humble ſenſe, that I am but ſinful duſt and aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; who have nothing to glory in, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther riches, nor strength, nor wiſdome; but only this (O how happy is it for me!) that I know thee, the ever living God, the Rock of Ages, the only ſolid founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our comfort and joy, who when my Fleſh and my Heart faileth, wilt be the strength of my Heart, and my Portion for ever.</p>
                  <p>I am now preſenting my Soul and Body to Thee, in perfect health: but cannot tell where I ſhall be the next moment, or whether I ſhall live to breath out the deſires of my Soul, once more, unto Thee. For in thy hand is the breath of our Noſtrils, and when thou pleaſeſt we are turned to deſtruction. We dwell in Houſes of Clay, whoſe foundation is in the duſt; and they are daily crumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and mouldering away, ſo that we know not how ſoon they will vaniſh and be ſeen no more. O how ſerious ſhould
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:94275:158"/>
the thoughts of this make me in all my addreſſes unto Thee? How dead to all the ſinful enjoyments of this World? How holy and pure? How heavenly minded and ſpiritual? How ready to do good, and to communicate to others thoſe things which I muſt ſhortly leave? How diligent to aſſure my ſelf thereby of better enjoyments, &amp; to make friends in Heaven; that when I go hence I may be received into everlaſting Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
                  <p>I ſee, O Lord, now that I think of my departure, how unprofitable my too many cares are for the things of this life: How vain my eager deſires after unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary riches, and honours: how tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling all my pleaſures; and that there is no ſolid happineſs but in thy love, and a pious hope of immortality. O my God, be ſo good to me as to turn my thoughts frequently toward my latter end: and to fix in my mind a lively ſenſe of the uncertainty of my being, and the fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all things belonging to it. That,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:94275:158"/>
ſince I muſt ſhortly leave them all, even my deareſt Friends and Kindred, and this body too, (which muſt be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to corruption) I may moſt zealouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſecure thy love and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in a better life, by the conſtant, chearful and earneſt exerciſe of all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and vertue, while I tarry here.</p>
                  <p>Help me to be as humble and lowly as the duſt to which I am going: to bury all anger, hatred, and enmities, ſince we muſt needs dye,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 14.14.</note> and be as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpilt upon the Ground, which cannot be gathered up again: to diſcharge my mind of all ſuperfluous cares, and of immoderate love of dying things: to enjoy them innocently and chearfully: to do good with them hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, and to envy no Man's greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity: to ſuffer evil, and to take the loſs of them patiently: to admire that mercy which still prolongs ſo frail a life as mine is: and eſpecially to admire the gracious terms of thy holy Goſpel, which, for our ſhort labours or ſufferings here,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:94275:159"/>
hath promiſed us the reward of an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs life in a better place. Diſpoſe me likewiſe to be willing to leave this World, and to be always in a readineſs for my departure: that I may never be ſurpriſed with ſudden Death, nor obey thy ſummons with an heavy heart; but freely reſign my ſpirit unto Thee, who gaveſt it.</p>
                  <p>O how much do I deſire the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of theſe holy thoughts and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: that ſo I may have ſuch a love to this world, as is conſiſtent with my hope of Heaven; and be ſo buſied in earthly affairs, that my heart may be there, where my treaſure is; and be tyed to my friends in ſuch affection, that we may not be eternally divorced. And the nearer I draw to that eternal World, O that I may be the more pure and ſeparated from all worldly mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and the clearer ſight and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect I may have of my happineſs; and attain the greater aſſurance of thy love; and be the fuller of joy in hope of thy

glory. Pitty my preſent weakneſs; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe my strength; help me not only to reſiſt, but to overcome all temptations; enable me to diſcharge the duties of my ſeveral relations; prepare me for all varieties of conditions; that in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity I may not forget Thee, nor imagine in adverſity that thou forgetteſt me, but in all I may be the ſame, and have the ſame thoughts of thee, love to thee, and delight in Thee, till I come to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable goodneſs and happineſs with the Lord Jeſus.</p>

               <p>BUT if you be ſo much diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at any time, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get your thoughts cloſe to this buſineſs, nor find any relief in any of the foregoing counſels; I muſt then, in the laſt place, ſend you to a never failing remedy; which is, to <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe a great deal of patience towards your ſelf.</hi> I am ſo well aſſured of your goodneſs, and that my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not herein blinded by my affection to you; that I dare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with this Advice: <hi>Be content to be dull ſometime, and able to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as you would; and yet do not think the worſe of your ſelf for it.</hi> But if it do ſtir up any ſuſpicions in your mind, of you do not know what fault; yet never bluſter at your ſelf, but with a calm and gentle ſpirit ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this diſtemper. Look upon your ſelf as ſick, and think that it is not good now to ſtir any humours. And
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:94275:160"/>
therefore ſtrive not too much neither with your ſelf [do not diſtruſt this counſel] when you are thus melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; for that will but caſt you more into it. You will be the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er eaſed, if you do as well as you can; and add not a greater load to your ſpirit, by your own fretful thoughts at this untoward indiſpoſition.</p>
               <p>You muſt conſider that our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being a part of this World, will be obnoxious to thoſe changes which are in things adjacent to them. And that your Soul being united to your Body, cannot but feel its viciſſitudes: Juſt as when the Houſe ſmoaks, the Inhabitant is offended, unleſs he can ſtep out of Doors.</p>
               <p>Conſider alſo that the ſame work is not required of a weak, and of a ſtronger Perſon. The <hi>Nemalim</hi> and the <hi>Gemalim</hi> (as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſpeaks) muſt not be alike loaded: that is, the Ants cannot carry ſuch a Burden as the Camels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:94275:161"/>You muſt thank God it is no worſe with you; and that you have not quite forgot Him. Thank him, I ſay, that you have any uſe of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that you are not under an abſolute ſtupidity.</p>
               <p>Remember likewiſe that it will be better with you. As long as there is the ſame Sun in Heaven, the Clouds will be diſperſed, and we ſhall have fair days as well as foul: and as long as our Lord lives and changes not, there will be a brighter ſeaſon, and we ſhall be warm as well as cold.</p>
               <p>Think likewiſe how unworthy the beſt of us is, to live always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun-beames. And that as there are many Countrys more North <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>gland,</hi> who in the depth of our Winter, are in a long and diſmal Night: ſo there are many Souls who are in a colder caſe, and more remote from the Sun of righteouſneſs, than yours is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:94275:161"/>But however think, that after you have done what you can, it is the will of God that you ſhould be as you are. And if this dulneſs pleaſe him, it need not diſpleaſe you.</p>
               <p>Remember alſo, that he is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in patience, who can bear with others, but not with himſelf.</p>
               <p>And again, that there is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon you ſhould bear with your ſelf; becauſe accidentally this dulneſs will breed a greater activity, when you come out of it: Both out of juſtice, that you may make ſome recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for that drowſineſs; and out of gratitude to him, by whoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you were delivered from it. For Nature, you know, inſtructs us to be very kind to thoſe who have helpt us ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of a very great diſtreſs; and it is not eaſie, to blot their readineſs to relieve us out of our memories.</p>
               <p>And beſides, it is manifeſt there
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:94275:162"/>
are ſome kinds of dulneſs and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which ariſe from the meer neceſſity of Nature: With which we can no more reaſonably quarrel; than we do becauſe it rains or ſnows, when we would have it fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Can it be expected, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that a Woman with Child ſhould be ſo vigorous as ſhe was wont? She muſt be content perhaps to ſpend that time in vomiting, which once ſhe did in praying. It muſt not put her to pain in this caſe, that ſhe cannot read or think ſo long, or with ſo much delight, or with ſuch clearneſs of underſtanding as formerly ſhe could: but ſhe muſt comply with her condition, and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering no more can be done in ſuch circumſtances, believe that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no more. There is as much reaſon to be troubled, becauſe ſhe hath not Wings to fly, or cannot walk now as faſt up her ſtairs, as when ſhe had no burden; as to chide her ſelf that ſhe cannot be ſo
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:94275:162"/>
earneſt, ſo long, ſo chearful as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in the performance of Holy Duties.</p>
               <p>There are many caſes like to this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which there is no more caution neceſſary, but to ſee that too much care of our eaſe, and indulgence to our preſent infirmity (which muſt at ſuch a time be liberally allowed) do not tempt us to be negligent in that, which it is in our power to perform. We may often retire to God in ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thoughts, and affectionate longings and pantings after him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by keeping our hearts in a glowing temper, we may prevent that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and lazineſs, which otherwiſe might creep upon us, and make us imagine our ſelves leſs able than we are. And particularly I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you, on ſuch occaſions, to lift up your Soul frequently to God in earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt deſires, beſeeching Him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you from cheating your ſelf; and that he would help you to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:94275:163"/>
clearly when it is the flattery, and when it is the meer weakneſs of Fleſh and Blood, that hinders you from doing as you were wont.</p>
               <p>When you caſt a glance, I ſay, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, and ſend up a ſigh thither now and then, (as you are able) let this be one of your deſires; that God would be ſo gracious, as to give you to feel plainly, when meer neceſſity requires your attendance on your Body, and when it calls for more than it needs. For he loves that in every thing we ſhould make known our requeſts to Him, and will certainly ſome way or other ſatisfie your mind in ſuch concernments. And when you have uſed the beſt judgment you have and can procure, together with your Prayers, about them; then I hope you will be chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and let your thoughts trouble you no more. Or if a thought ſhould happen to ſtart up and ſtrike your mind, telling you that you are lazy
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:94275:163"/>
yet believe, I beſeech you, your more deliberate, and not theſe ſuddain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</p>
               <p>There is one caſe, I know, of this kind, wherein though it be certain that it is impoſſible for us to do as we were wont, and that we are not hindred by any fault in our will, but by the meer indiſpoſition of nature, yet it may be hard ſometime to avoid dejected and complaining thoughts upon this account: It is in ſickneſs; when the Mind neceſſarily languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es with the Body. You may chance then to imagine that ſome ſin or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the cauſe of this Correction (and ſo you have drawn this diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity upon your ſelf) for which you cannot now be humbled as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. But I hope, <hi>My Friend,</hi> that you take ſuch an exact view of your life, that ſickneſs will not let you ſee any fault, that was not viſible to you before. And I know you to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, than to torment your ſelf with
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:94275:164"/>
a fancy that there is ſome ſin lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in you, though you cannot find it out. But if any thing ſhould diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſelf to you, which was not ſo evident before; let me beſeech you, not to paſs any hard cenſure upon your ſelf: But to remember that this hath been bewailed whenſoever you lamented the general infirmity of your nature; and that now perhaps it is repreſented to you more ugly than it doth deſerve, or if it be not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet it is ſufficient only to beg of God to accept your hearty confeſſion and your promiſe of amendment (when you are able) and to deſire your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual guide to be the witneſs of your ſincere reſolution, and to give you abſolution, and his bleſſing; and ſo reſt ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>But there may be another reaſon likewiſe aſſigned of our heavineſs at certain ſeaſons, which I have no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> yet named: and that is, the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, in a great meaſure, of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:94275:164"/>
ſtrength and power which was upon us from the Holy-Ghoſt, to raiſe and elevate us to an high pitch of love, activity, and joy in well doing. For as the help of that doth lift us up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our ſelves, ſo, when it much abates, we are apt to fall as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our ſelves; and to be ſurpriſed with ſadneſs and dejection of ſpirit, to ſee our ſelves ſo ſtrangely changed. And this may be denyed us for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes; either becauſe we have not improved it, ſo well as we might; or becauſe our Lord ſees that our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot bear always ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary motions; or that he may make us more ſenſible of his favours, and raiſe their price and value in our eſteem; or that he may try our ſtrength, as a Mother lets go her hold of the Child, to make it feel its Feet; or that he may thereby bow our wills more abſolutely to his, and break our ſelf-love, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires nothing but pleaſure; or that he may prove whether we will love
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:94275:165"/>
him for himſelf, and not for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate entertainments which he gives us; or for ſome ſuch cauſe unknown to you and me, and every body elſe.</p>
               <p>And ſhall we not yield ſubmiſſion quietly, to a thing for which there may be ſo many reaſons; and thoſe not at all to our prejudice, but to our profit? Let me ſay a few words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the two laſt things menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; and ſhow you that if our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience be exerciſed upon thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, it will prove very beneficial to our Souls.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſay (as ſome have done) that we ought not to deſire goodneſs for our own good, but meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is pleaſing to God. No; this ſeems to me a very abſurd doctrine, and utterly impoſſible, that we ſhould ſeparate theſe two, Piety, and our own good. We cannot ſo much as deſire to be good, but we ſhall feel a ſatisfaction in it. For the very Name
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:94275:165"/>
of good carries a reſpect in it, to ſomething in us to which it is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and convenient. We do not mean when we bid you love God for himſelf, that you ſhould not therein love your ſelf, and ſeek your own contentment; for you cannot chuſe but be pleaſed in the love of God and vertue. But this I may affirm with ſafety; that there may be ſometimes too much of ſelf-love in our vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deſires after the extraordinary pleaſures and joyes of piety: and that if we could be content, after we uſed due diligence, with our drineſs and barrenneſs of ſpirit, with our dulneſs and want of vigour, nay, with our frailties and faults too, meerly out of ſubmiſſion to God, and becauſe he thinks not fit to give us the pleaſure of being wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them; it would be highly accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him, and no leſs advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to us. If in all things, I mean, we could reſt ſatisfied that God's will is done, though ours be denyed,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:94275:166"/>
if we could forbear to proſecute our own will even in thoſe matters, and deſire him to give us as much Life, and Spirit, and chearfulneſs and joy as he pleaſes; we ſhould be ſo far from offending him, that he would take it for a very grateful piece of ſervice to him.</p>
               <p>This is not to teach any remiſneſs in your deſires and endeavours; but it ſuppoſes you do your beſt, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adviſes you, that if notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you cannot be as you would, you do not let your ſpirit fall into any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience or fretfulneſs. For this is to prefer God's pleaſure above your own. It is a ſubjection of your will to his, in thoſe points wherein you are moſt deſirous to have it gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is an unuſual inſtance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to him; which declares there is nothing ſo dear to you, but you are willing to quit it, ſo you may but do well, and be accepted with Him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:94275:166"/>And here remember theſe two things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that <hi>our ſolid comfort doth not depend upon doing every thing ſo readily, eaſily and delightfully as we would; but in accompliſhing Gods will, however it be done.</hi> And 2dly, That <hi>Humility, Patience and Submiſſion to God in the midſt of our infirmities, may be more acceptable to him than that complacence and joy which we feel to ariſe meerly from the ſenſe that we have of our strength and abilities.</hi> To be pleaſed in our ſucceſſes is not ſo pleaſing to God, as to be patient in our Conteſts. Nay, to rejoyce and triumph in our Victories, is nothing ſo good, as to be conſtant and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, notwithſtanding that we are a little overcome. In thoſe ſpiritual conſolations which we thirſt after, we do not always receive ſo much profit as we do pleaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in the want of them, if our wills be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by more perfectly ſubdued to his, we receive both a very great benefit, and in the iſſue, no ſmall pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:94275:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>You have ſeen perhaps, or you may imagine, the ſmoak of a Potters Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace; how thick and black it is, as if it would make a Picture of Hell it ſelf. Who would think that the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Clay, which are baked there, would not be burnt to aſhes by the fury of the Fire; or that at leſt they would come out as black as ſoote, by the foulneſs of the ſmoak? And yet when the Fire is put out, and the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels unfurnaced, you ſee there is no ſuch thing: But that which was ſoft and yielding, is become hard and ſtrong; and its complexion likewiſe is ſo much mended, that a Prince need not diſdain the uſe of ſome of theſe Cups. Juſt thus it is with a diſtreſſed Soul, when it is covered with a Cloud, and wrapt in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and burns thereby in a great and ſore diſpleaſure againſt it ſelf. It is apt to think, that this ſure is the Gate of Hell; that it is forſaken of God; and ſhall either periſh in this condition, or not eſcape out of it,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:94275:167"/>
without much loſs. But after a while, when the work of God is done, and the vapours are vaniſhed and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, it findes it ſelf to be grown much in firmneſs, purity and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor; and that it is made a Veſſel of honour fit for the Maſters uſe. There is no loſs of any thing, but of its ſelf-will. Nothing is conſumed but its ſoftneſs and delicacy; which made it loth to be toucht.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of many lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle paſſions and diſorderly deſires, to which our frail Natures are ſubject. If we can free our ſelves from one inordinate paſſion, which is a too vehement deſire to be quite rid of them; it might bring us little leſs peace, than if we were: and our profiting would no leſs appear, in continuing ſtill to do our duty, of which we complain that they are ſo great an hinderance. However, there is no reaſon for ſuch concluſions as thoſe, which good minds have been
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:94275:168"/>
apt to make in a gloomy day; that if God loved them, he would not treat them after that manner. There is rather great reaſon, conſidering what hath been ſaid, to be not only patient, but thankful to him in ſuch a condition. For it is not inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with his care and infinite kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to let us be obnoxious to thoſe changes, and thoſe weakneſſes too, which I have mentioned: but you ſee plainly it muſt be ſo; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is beſt to be well pleaſed with theſe Methods of our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at leaſt contented that it ſhould be ſo.</p>
               <p>And let me add this for a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Diſcourſe; that God may ſuffer ſome Perſons to be thus overcaſt with darkneſs, and he may with-hold his gracious influences from them, for the ſins of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life, before they were converted; which deſerved he ſhould never have afforded his grace unto them at all.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:94275:168"/>
What are we, ſhould ſuch Men ſay, that we ſhould expect to live always under the light of his countenance? Alas! one age of darkneſs is too good for us; and we have reaſon to thank him, if we be not eternally baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his ſight. Why ſhould ſuch poor things as we think to receive every day ſome extraordinary tokens of his Divine favour; when one good look from him, is enough to oblige us as long as we live? How much more reaſon have we to praiſe him, that all our days are not gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that our Sun is not always eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or rather that our life is but one long Night; than to complain that a Cloud ſometimes paſſes over us, or a Miſt gathers about us? It is but fit that we ſhould be hereby taught what it is to ſin againſt God; and it is well for us that we were not ſent to learn it in outer darkneſs. We are not ill dealt withall, if we can learn at ſo cheap a rate the value of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning mercy: but ſhall have cauſe
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:94275:169"/>
in Heaven to praiſe God, that we paid no dearer for it. Is this all the puniſhment that is due for our many faults? Doth he not uſe us very kindly, if we be not quite caſt out of his Preſence? O what a joy will it be to us, to find that we are in his favour in the other World? And we may be content, if he pleaſe, to ſtay for our joy till that time; when we ſhall certainly know, whether we have reaſon to rejoyce or no.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall ſay no more of this to you, who have ſpent your time ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently and vertuouſly, that there is reaſon you ſhould reap the fruit of it now in perpetual joy and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart, from the conſideration of God's goodneſs to you. And I had wholly omitted this laſt Advice, did not I know the weakneſs of humane Nature to be ſo great, that the beſt diſpoſed Souls may ſometimes feel ſuch alterations in them, as may make it very neceſſary. In which
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:94275:169"/>
caſe, if ever you ſhould find your ſelf, doubt not to approach to God, and ſay to him, with all humility of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſome ſuch words as theſe.</p>
               <div type="prayer">
                  <head>A PRAYER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Acknowledg, O great God, the Lord of Heaven and Earth, that I am not worthy of the leaſt glimpſe of thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour. It is ſufficient that I live and behold the light of the Sun, and am not baniſhed into outer darkneſs. And it is more than enough, for ſo wretched a thing as I am, that thou art pleaſed, at any time of my life, to beſtow upon me the ſmalleſt teſtimony of thy love. But that I live in hope to paſs through all theſe Clouds, and to behold my bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour in inconceivable ſplendor, and rejoyce with him for ever; O what a grace is it! How infinitely am I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:94275:170"/>
to Thee, for ſuch riches of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy! It ought to make me contented with any condition here; and exceeding thankful to Thee, that it is no worſe. Deal with me, O merciful God, even as thou pleaſeſt, ſo that I may but have this humble hope preſerved in my heart, of ſeeing and loving my Lord, not as now darkly and dully, but in the cleareſt light, and with the moſt ardent love, in Immortal Glory.</p>
                  <p>I ſubmit to thy Infinite Wiſdome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all that heavineſs and liſtleſneſs of ſpirit, wherewith I am oppreſſed; from which I know thy Infinite Power, if thou didst judg it moſt convenient, is able to deliver me. Thou art not unwilling nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I know, to gratifie the deſires of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearts, who ſincerely long after a state of more perfect love to Thee, and would gladly with more active and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied ſpirits ſerve thee, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. But ſince thou art pleaſed to leave us to contend with many and great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of our mortal Nature, thy will
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:94275:170"/>
be done. I deſerved none of that power and strength from above, which I have received; O that I could ſay that I have alwayes imployed it, or been ſo thankful for it, as I ought! By thy grace I am what I am. And by its aſſiſtance I hope to perſevere in my duty, and in thy love; though thou denyeſt me all the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which I am inclined to deſire. I am content to ſerve thee on any terms; yea deſirous to have my will ſubdued, in every thing, perfectly unto thine.</p>
                  <p>O that I may but feel my Soul grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more humble, more ſubmiſſive, more patient, more intirely reſigned to thy pleaſure; and I ſhall think my ſelf a great gainer, by all the loads and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures under which I groan. O that they may depreſs me more in my own thoughts; and make me more admire thy indulgent kindneſs which exerciſes no greater ſeverity upon me; and raiſe in me an higher eſteem of thoſe favours, which thou art pleaſed at any time to communicate to me; and make me place
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:94275:171"/>
my ſatisfaction, in a conſtant and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute obedience to Thee (whatſoever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements I meet withall) and in the expectation of an happy tranſlation from this earthly state to an Heavenly, which thou haſt promiſed as the reward of faithful obedience.</p>
                  <p>Into thy hands, O Lord, I now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my Spirit, as I muſt do when I leave this World. I truſt my ſelf with Thee; beſeeching thee to conduct me ſafe through all varieties and changes both bodily and ſpiritual, unto thy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reſt. And for that end, beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me ſuch an attentive and ſincerely diſcerning ſpirit, that I may never be cheated by the lazineſs of fleſhly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; nor call that my infirmity, which is my careleſneſs and negligence. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me from all affected Ignorance, from idleneſs, from raſhneſs, from ſelf-flattery and preſumption: as well as from all cauſleſs jealouſies of my ſelf, and too much ſadneſs and dejection of ſpirit. Help me to overgrow daily the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:94275:171"/>
unſteadineſs of my mind and thoughts, and that backwardneſs which is in my will and affections; together with all other imperfections and weakneſſes of this state. But as for all the luſts of the fleſh, the luſts of the eye, or the pride of life, O my God, I hope I ſhall be a perfect stranger to them, and far remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from them.</p>
                  <p>Help me in all conditions stedfaſtly to love the good which thou haſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and the good which thou haſt promiſed: And enable me as patiently to bear the evil which thou inflicteſt, and as vehemently to hate the evil which thou forbideſt, and to be much afraid of the evil which thou threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and to be well pleaſed with every thing that thou ſendeſt. If thou makeſt me rich, keep me from being wanton, or proud, or in love with this World, or loth to leave it: Help me diſcreetly to taſte of theſe good things, but to live upon thoſe which are Heavenly. And
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:94275:172"/>
if thou art pleaſed to reduce me into want, keep me from all repining thoughts, from diſtruſt of Thee, and from too great carefulneſs and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of mind: and help me then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that I have still the ſame moſt loving Father, who fed me in the days of my fulneſs and proſperity. While I have my health, good Lord, make me ſerviceable; that if I be ſick, I may not be diſconſolate, nor uneaſie to my ſelf and others. In all my employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments diſpoſe me to be chearful, in all my enjoyments thankful, and on all occaſions very watchful, that I fall not into temptation: And be thou my Guide, my Helper, my Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, my Comforter, and indulgent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo, that if I do fall, I may not utterly be caſt down; but live in hope to recover more ſtrength, and to Glorifie Thee by bringing forth much and better Fruit, through Chriſt Jeſus our bleſſed Saviour. <hi>By whom I believe in Thee who
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:94275:172"/>

               <p>THUS, <hi>My Friend,</hi> I have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed this little <hi>Labour of Love</hi> (to ſpeak in the Language of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1.3.) which I wiſh may prove ſo ſerviceable to you, that it may do more than produce that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of hope</hi> in you, which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the ſame place. I would have you to be filled with the joy of hope, or, as he ſpeaks in another E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, (XV. Rom. 13.) <hi>with all joy and peace in believing.</hi> It becomes one of your underſtanding and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: nor is there any greater effect of true Wiſdome (as <hi>Seneca</hi> hath obſerved) than the equality and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venneſs of our joy. Nothing ſure can hinder it in you, but the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality perhaps at ſometimes of your bodily temper, which is not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided. But in that caſe I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed you what to do; and I am ſure you will not fail to follow my Directions therein, and in all the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:94275:173"/>
reſt, whatſoever pains it coſt you. For I need not ſend you to <hi>Muſonius</hi> to learn this great truth (of which you are as ſenſible as it is incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) that <hi>if a Man do any good thing with labour, the labour paſſes ſoon away, but the good remains: and if he do any evil with pleaſure, the pleaſure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently flies away, but the evil remains.</hi> So great is the difference between doing well, and doing ill, that you can never, I know, be tempted from the one unto the other. It is too late now to put a cheat upon you. The pleaſures of ſin cannot deceive one, whoſe ſenſes are ſo well exerciſed to diſcern between good and evil. You may be abuſed, it is poſſible, with fears and jealouſies of your ſelf; and be caſt down when you have no liſt to do any thing that is good, or when you miſtake, or have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a little fault: but as I ſaid in the beginning, ſo I conclude, be ſure you hold faſt an unmoveable belief of the goodneſs of God to you;
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:94275:174"/>
which will defend you from the danger of thoſe aſſaults, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all the miſchief which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they might do you.</p>
               <p>He doth not expect Children without all faults; and you may be ſure cannot be unwilling to pardon them, when he knows that's the way to incourage them to grow better. There is no reaſon to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect his ſincerity, when he tells us, that he deſires not the Death of a Sinner: Or to imagine that he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly undermines us, while he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly profeſſes love and friendſhip to us: or to fear that he intends to make us the Trophees of his meer Power and Greatneſs; or to draw us after Him, as his Captives, in any other Chariot than that of his Omnipotent Goodneſs, in which he rides all the World over. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, and it will never let you deſpond in the worſt condition; nor ſuffer you to be jealous of any of his
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:94275:174"/>
commands, or fancy that he will lay impoſſible tasks upon you. And you will have as little cauſe to be ſuſpicious of his Providence, or to take too heavily any thing that he doth: but will ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, notwithſtanding any objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or contrary appearances, that all things ſhall work together for your good. And whatſoever there is that might diſhearten you, this will make you perſiſt in a reſolute perſwaſion that GOD is willing and deſirous to receive your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and will grant a gracious anſwer. He cannot envy his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to any: nor loves he to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his kindneſs within himſelf. For envy proceeds from weakneſs and from want, which incline a Perſon to ſeek how he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs every thing, and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it to his own particular being. But he who in his own Nature is ſo perfect that he can want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:94275:175"/>
is inclined no doubt to let others participate with him in his happineſs, ſince he will ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as full as he was.</p>
               <p>You think it is impoſſible (as <hi>Proclus</hi> well ſayes) that darkneſs ſhould approach the Sun, who is the Parent of Light:<note place="margin">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> But it is more impoſſible that any envy ſhould touch God, whoſe Nature is ſo excellent, that he hath given to all what they have. What is there left for him to envy, who hath already all that can be? For what want can there be in Infinite Fulneſs? What Weakneſs and Infirmity in the Omnipotent Deity? Who is there that can ſhare and go halfs with the Fountain of all Good? Let Us not therefore look upon GOD, as if we thought Him afraid that we ſhould be too good, or enjoy too much good; or as
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:94275:175"/>
if He were unwilling we ſhould be exceeding happy. For He is ſuch a Good, that He hath filled and repleniſhed all things; and doth good, and beſtows Benefits continually upon them all. And why ſhould you think your ſelf excluded out of the vaſt compaſs of his Love; or imagine after He hath done ſo much for you, that his Bounty is exhauſted? Do you not feel what kindneſs GOD hath implanted in our Hearts, towards each other? How free, how diligent, how unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a Friend is in ſerving a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom he loves intirely? And what is there better natur'd than that Religion which Chriſt hath taught Us; the top of which is Love and Charity; and that is both a Bountiful, and a Meek, and a Patient Vertue? For it <hi>ſuffers long and is kind,</hi> ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> begins its Character; <hi>it beares
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:94275:176"/>
all things, and indures all things,</hi> ſo he ends it. And is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, do you think, that GOD ſhould give Us that, which is not in Himſelf? Or that He ſhould command Us to accompliſh our Souls with that Perfection, which is not eminent in his own moſt excellent Nature? We are ſure that our loving kindneſs is but a weak imitation of His. And therefore may conclude that He will have Patience with Us, and not be eaſily provoked; but bear with our Infirmities, and be exceeding kind in beſtowing his Bleſſings, and Pardoning our Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and delight in doing both; becauſe there is nothing He ſo much delights to ſee in Us, as this Image of His loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. So the greateſt Men in the Church of CHRIST have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>
